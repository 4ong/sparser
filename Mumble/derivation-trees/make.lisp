#| For both adjuncts and complements, we get the most flexibility
in choice of realization if we have already determined how we
want them done as part of making the choice to treat as, e.g., 
a complement vs. the main verb ("acquire" vs. "acquisition").

Alreay determining the realization means having dtn's as the
values, rather than model-level objects (as at the moment 12/13/09).

With model-level objects as the values, the realization will
be determined in place (e.g. in a subject slot) by a call to 
realization-for, which is ok if a realization of the necessary
type is available (inevitable when reversing specific texts),
but we don't want to count on that.
