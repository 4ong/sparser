;;--- Misc. information about the rule set

;; This is part of an experiment to see which semantic rules, other than
;;  etf rules for NPs and non-etf semantic rules are actually needed in biology,
;;  given the subcat-frame mechanism
;; When this parameter is set, the only semantic rules actually applied are those for
;; NPs, and special purpose rules
(defparameter *no-etf-rules* nil)
;; when *no-etf-rules* is set, *semantic-rules-used* collects the actual set of
;; semantic rules used in processing the snapshot corpora
(defparameter *semantic-rules-used* nil)
;; The total set of such rules is:
#|
#<PSR45391  modal ->  modal then> 
#<PSR45413  protein ->  protein point-mutation> 
#<PSR949  comma-number ->  COMMA number> 
#<PSR45411  residue-on-protein ->  protein residue-on-protein> 
#<PSR658  be ->  be not> 
#<PSR1088  measurement ->  number unit-of-measure> 
#<PSR1123  comma-year ->  COMMA year> 
#<PSR45407  residue-on-protein ->  amino-acid number> 
#<PSR1153  amount-of-time ->  number time-unit>
