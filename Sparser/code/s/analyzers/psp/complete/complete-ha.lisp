;;;   Version:   July 2016

;; 1.1  (5/2 v1.8.4)  Modified Complete-edge to check the quiescent
;;      position of the forest-level parser
;; 1.2  (10/21 v2.0) Overhauled it to streamline/make-consistent the
;;      calling patterns & hooks.
;;      (11/1) put in *do-completion-actions* in place of *..action..*
;; 1.3 (7/14/92 v2.3) bumped version to 3 to go with changing the call
;;       for anaphor recording of edges.
;; 3.1 (5/3/93) added status setting to word completion routine
;; 3.2 (6/11) passed positions through to next stage
;; 3.3 (12/6) flushed the polyword case since it's subsumed by edges
;; 3.4 (6/6/94) added a optional subsumption test on edges
;; 3.5 (7/12) redefined the subsumption test as an alist to handle arbitrary depth
;;     (7/22) put a patch in it to get around a separate bug
;;     (10/13/97) put a model gate in Complete-edge/hugin.
;;     (2/5/07) converted e{type}case to use otherwise & break
;;     (7/14/08) Made "hugin" lowercase in anticipation of lower-casing
;;      all functions.
;;     (2/8/13) Fixed incorrect status setter
;;     (6/6/15) Added cache-local-edge-referent-pair to the edge case
;; 3.6 (6/8/15) Folded in polywords throughout.
;;      Diagnostics for edge-referents which are CONS cells --
;;        break is controlled by parameter *diagnose-consp-referents*
;;      Installed (note-surface-string edge) to provide information
;;        for cards.

#| Hugin (??)
This is one of the oldest files in Sparser. When it was first written
there were three alternatives functions that could be run when an edge
or word was completed ("complete" comes from Earley's algorithm).
The other two were dropped from the load quite some time ago, leaving
this one, which was the 'smartest' of the three, mostly because of the
edge subsumption check and the use of the same algorithm in the
discourse update. 

Hugin ("HOO-gin") was one of the two ravens that aided Odin. The other
was Muninn. Hugin was the spirit of thought, Muninn of desire. 
They are often depicted as perching on Odin's shoulders.
