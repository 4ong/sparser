;;;   Version:   December 2015

;; initiated in May 2015
;; Code to place referents in a description lattice to facilitate anaphora and other reasoning
;; 5/30/2015 added a bunch more functionality to description (not-yet-quite-a)lattice
;; 6/20.2015 substantial cleanup for this file -- revised data structures and methods
;; still need to deal with implied superc and subc links

;; First test on compare-to-snapshots d=generated many more elements in the
;;  lattice than I would have expected set *no-description-lattice* to have
;;  this called when parsing

;; 7/7/2015 Maintain the indiv-restrictions field, which contains a list of
;;  all the immediate superior referential categories (1 in most cases, but
;;  can be more than on for a join) and all of the dli-vvâ€™s which have been
;;  produced by the set of bind-variable operations that defined this
;;  individual.
;; Added predicate more-specific? which tests relative position
;;  (subsumption) in the description lattice.
;; 8/12/15 Moved call to use-description-lattice to switches (bio-setting)
;; 12/21/15 Set default value of *description-lattice* to nil to avoid load-
;;  time gratuitous side-effects.
