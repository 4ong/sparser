;;;  version:  June 2017

;; initiated in 1/9/95. Added string printer 1/9/96.
;; 0.1 (11/25/99) Changed the realizations to use the new schema protocol
;;      and flushed the treatment of prepositions that take np complements
;;      over to its own file [spatial prepositions] with their category
;;      in [places;object]. Broke out the two types as their own subcategories
;; 1.0 (9/5/07) Dumped the schema-driven realizations since they were just
;;  for 'standalone-word' and the rules they created instantiated the specific
;;  categories rather than the more general 'direction' category which is the
;;  better semantic discriptor. 11/1 Added hack from-direction. 
;; 1/4/16 putting rules on their individuals.

 of terms that indicate direction: compass points, orientation terms
 like 'left' or 'front', and 'prospective direction phrases' (Hudson &
 Pullum p.688) like 'inwards'.
   We have to bind another instance of the variable name here because
 it's been restricted at location to 'name-of-location' (e.g. 'London')
 and/// the restriction parser doesn't understand the :primitive notation
 that we need.")

;;---- "(to the) {left, front} (of <reference-point>)"
;;      "the left side of the block"  "the Left Bank"

;; These are np heads.  When their deictic anchors are given explicitly
;; they appear as prepositional complements: "left of the garage"
;; except in the case of proper names where they're also simple classifiers:
;; "(to) John's left". 
;;   They also can be used adjectivally: "John's left ear", and Pullum lists
;; "left" as an adjective, so we have to be careful about the choice of
;; brackets. I'm going with the brackets that start NPs but not the finishers.
