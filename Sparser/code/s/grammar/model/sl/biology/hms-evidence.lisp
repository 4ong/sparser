"In response to DNA replication perturbation, ATR activates Chk1 by phosphorylation on Ser317 and Ser345 in an absolute Claspin dependent manner leading to cell cycle arrest and recovery." 
"For instance, AKT1 destabilizes p53 via the phosphorylation of Mdm2 [XREF_BIBR]; AKT1 controls the basal expression of XRCC1 [XREF_BIBR]; the activation of AKT1 leads to the sequestration of CHK1 to the cytoplasm [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR], and AKT1 phosphorylates and prevents the activation of CHK1 by ATR and ATM [XREF_BIBR]; finally, AKT1 reduces the abundance of gamma-gH2AX foci [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR] in asynchronous cells, and inhibits the activation of CHK1 and the repair of DSBs at the end of G2 [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Chk1 and Chk2 are proteins that are activated following DNA damage; Chk1 is activated by ATR  (ataxia-telangiectasia and Rad3 related) primarily in response to the detection of single strand breaks bulky lesions, while Chk2 is activated by ATM  (ataxia-telangiectasia mutated) following the detection of double strand breaks in DNA [XREF_BIBR]." 
"The ATR complex assembles at stalled replication fork and activates checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1)." 
"On the other hand, depletion of MTA1 compromises the ATR mediated Chk1 activation following UV treatment, accompanied by a marked down-regulation of Chk1 and its interacting partner Claspin, an adaptor protein that is required for the phosphorylation and activation of Chk1 by ATR." 
"These genes include CHEK1, which participates in the G2/M checkpoint and is activated by ATR in response to unresolved DNA damage, and BRCA1, which is in a surveillance complex that activates double-strand break repair." 
"Chk1 activation by ATR also requires 9-1-1 complex loading by the Rad17 and RFC complex as well as several essential \" mediators \"." 
"This could be due to the fact that activation of CHEK1 by ATR leads to its proteolyic degradation." 
"The data presented herein suggest that during S phase low levels and low activity of Plk1 contribute to the accumulation of Claspin, which mediates the activation of Chk1 by ATR." 
"Generally, ATM activates Chk2, while ATR primarily activates Chk1, although considerable cross-talk between ATM and ATR occurs." 
"Similarly, in response to UV induced DNA damage, ATR activates Chk1 and p38 SAPK activates MAPKAP kinase-2, leading to phosphorylation of the same core motif on Cdc25 family members." 
"ATR activates Chk1 by phosphorylating this protein on at least two residues (Ser 317 and Ser 345) located in a Ser and Thr-Gln-rich domain ()." 
"It is well accepted that the ATR dependent activation of Chk1 in response to incompletely replicated and damaged DNA leads to inhibition of origin firing at chromosomal regions that are not already engaged in replication  (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR)." 
"Although in most cases engagement of the mitochondrial pathway is caspase independent (as noted above), Bid is activated by caspases and therefore can link other routes of caspase activation (e.g., death receptor signaling) to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Here we showed that, besides the specific cleavage and activation of Bid by caspase-8 and caspase-3, TRAIL induced apoptosis in Jurkat T cells required the specific cleavage of Mcl-1 at Asp 127 and Asp 157 by caspase-3, while other prototypic antiapoptotic factors such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-X (L) seemed not to be affected." 
"The activation of Bid by caspase-8 in this pathway promotes further cytochrome c release, thereby completing a positive feedback loop of caspase activation." 
"BID, a pro apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family, is activated by caspase 8, and translocates to OM followed by catalysis of MMP (XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR)." 
"The RAS activated BRAF kinase plays a central role in the regulation of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, which regulates cell division, proliferation and differentiation in melanoma, and thus is considered a promising target for anti-melanoma therapies [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR]." 
"This paper finds that, although unfarnesylated Ras can bind B-Raf, only farnesylated Ras can activate B-Raf in an in vitro activation system." 
"In summary, we have found that inhibition of Rce1- and Icmt catalyzed modifications does not prevent Rheb activation of mTOR, and that FTS inhibits mTOR through a mechanism that does not involve Rheb inhibition." 
"Full-length TSC2 protein interacts with TSC1 to inhibit the activation of mTOR by Rheb." 
"In addition to Rheb 's activation of mTOR, Rheb also inhibits the activity of B-Raf and C-Raf kinase (,)." 
"AKT phosphorylation of TSC2 inhibits activity of TSC1 and TSC2 complex, which allows GTP bound Rheb to accumulate and activate the mTOR of mTORC1." 
"In mammalian cells, in response to AAs, the Rag GTPase complex recruits mTORC1 to lysosomes, where mTOR is activated by Rheb (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR)." 
"GTP bound RHEB is known to activate mTOR, whereas GDP bound RHEB loses its ability to activate mTOR, suggesting that the TSC1 and TSC2 complex can downregulate the mTOR pathway through suppressing RHEB function.Upregulation of the TSC and mTOR signaling pathway has been implicated in the development of cancers." 
"We further found that SIRT2 deacetylation of ATRIP at K32 drives ATR autophosphorylation and signaling and facilitates DNA replication fork progression and recovery of stalled replication forks following replication stress, demonstrating that SIRT2 functions as an important regulator of ATR activity and helping to explain why Sirt2 deficiency results in genomic instability and cancer development." 
"ATRIP Acetylation at Lysine 32 Impairs ATR Autophosphorylation and Signaling." 
"SIRT2 depletion significantly reduced ATR autophosphorylation, but not total ATR levels, in response to HU treatment (XREF_FIG), suggesting that SIRT2 promotes ATR activation in response to replication stress." 
"SIRT2 deacetylation of ATRIP at K32 drives ATR autophosphorylation and signaling and facilitates DNA replication fork progression and recovery of stalled replication forks." 
"Finally, expression of HA-ATRIP WT but not K32Q alleviated the impairment in HU induced ATR autophosphorylation and CHK1 Ser317 phosphorylation following SIRT2 depletion (XREF_FIG), strongly suggesting that the effects of SIRT2 depletion on ATR activation are mediated through K32 deacetylation." 
"First, ATM dependent phosphorylation of CHK2 promotes not only CHK2 autophosphorylation, but also phosphorylation of the phosphatase CDC25A, which targets it to the proteasome." 
"PML and RARalpha in APL suppresses Chk2 by dominantly inhibiting the auto-phosphorylation step, but inactivation of PML and RARalpha with alltrans retinoic acid (ATRA) restores Chk2 autophosphorylation and activity." 
"Interestingly, ULK1 overexpression also increases phosphorylation of Raptor Ser863 and the mTOR autophosphorylation site, Ser2481 in a mTORC1 dependent manner." 
"Utilizing prostate cancer and bladder cancer cell lines, our data support our hypothesis that E2F1 suppresses SIRT6 transcription and facilities cancer cell glycolysis." 
"Our finding on the repression of SIRT6 transcription by E2F1 will broaden the therapeutic opportunities to enhance SIRT6 tumor suppressor activities with compounds like CDK4/6 inhibitor, which retains E2F1 in the RB and E2F1 complex by diminishing the phosphorylation of RB by CDK4/6." 
"Based on the published study on the metabolic phenotype of E2F1 -/- mice and SIRT6 -/- mice, we hypothesize that E2F1 enhances glycolysis and inhibits the expression of Sirt6." 
"Here we tested our hypothesis in bladder and prostate cancer cell lines and found that E2F1 could indeed suppress SIRT6 transcription and promote cancer cell glycolysis." 
"Restoring p53 by depletion of E6 also reduced the level of active Plk1 on chromatin (T210P level; XREF_FIG)." 
"In addition, activation of p53 has been shown to suppress the transcription of Plk1 directly or via the p21 dependent mechanism." 
"Downregulation of PLK1 expression by p53 is relieved by the histone deacetylase inhibitor, trichostatin A, and involves recruitment of histone deacetylase to the vicinity of p53RE2, further supporting a transcriptional repression mechanism." 
"Our finding that p21 mediates the DNA damage induced p53 dependent suppression of PLK1 does not exclude the possibility of direct suppression of PLK1 transcription by p53." 
"We have previously shown in H1299 cells stably transfected with a temperature sensitive p53 mutant (tsp53) that the induction of functional p53 decreases PLK1 protein levels in a p21 dependent manner." 
"Together, these data indicate that p53 negatively regulates PLK1 expression, while E2F1 positively regulates PLK1 expression.E2F1 is implicated in activating the PLK1 gene, but yet the mechanism is unknown." 
"Recent evidence from a knockout mouse model suggests that p21 is required for p53 dependent repression of Plk1 expression [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Mechanistically, this is mediated by p53 which represses PLK1 expression through chromatin remodelling." 
"PLK1 is down-regulated by p53 as part of the G2/M cell cycle checkpoint [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR] and we recently established that this occurs mainly through p53 dependent repression of PLK1 expression [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Additionally, wild type, but not mutant, p53 represses expression of the PLK1 promoter when fused upstream of a reporter gene." 
"The knock-down of YBX1 reduced CCNB1 expression, confirming the role of YBX1 as a CCNB1 regulator in these cells (XREF_FIG)." 
"At molecular level, YB-1 shRNA plasmids were successfully delivered into tumor cells and downregulated the expression of YB-1 and Cyclin D1 (XREF_FIG)." 
"In agreement with a direct involvement of YB-1 in regulating cyclin D1 expression, YB-1 knockdown led to increased cyclin D1 levels (B)." 
"Taken together, these results suggest that the primary reason for the G1/S phase growth arrest in YB-1 knockdown human OS cells was decreased expression of cyclin D1, followed by downregulation of cyclin A. Knockdown of YB-1 inhibited the growth of OS graft tumours in vivo." 
"Together, these results show that altered cyclin A expression following YB-1 knockdown in OS cells is secondary to reduction of cyclin D1." 
"As cyclin D1 is well defined target genes of E2F1 (XREF_BIBR), reduction of cyclin D1 expression by si-YB-1 in OS cells could be the reflection of si-YB-1-induced reduction of E2F1." 
"The expression of cyclin D1 and cyclin A were also decreased by si-YB-1." 
"Lack-of-function siRNA screening revealed that DUSP1 preferentially dephosphorylates p38 protein and is involved in Ang-1-induced cell migration and differentiation." 
"Anti-inflammatory effects of glucocorticoids (GCs) are partly mediated by up-regulation of DUSP1 (dual specificity phosphatase 1), which dephosphorylates and inactivates mitogen activated protein kinases." 
"DUSP1 dephosphorylates mitogen-activated protein kinases, which are evolutionary conserved enzymes that play an important role in orchestrating various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis." 
"Mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase-1 (MKP-1) dephosphorylates mitogen activated protein kinase [extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH (2)-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38], mediates breast cancer chemoresistance, and is repressible by doxorubicin in breast cancer cells." 
"These results show that DUSP1 catalyzed the dephosphorylation of p38 MAPK and thereby inactivated p38 MAPK in A549 and J774 cells." 
"This study also demonstrated for the first time that MKP-1 dephosphorylation of p38MAPK and JNK may participate in TSA 's protective actions in HUVECs exposed to LPS, an inflammatory stimulus.Stress kinases, p38MAPK and JNK, play critical roles in COX-2 expression under the influence of inflammatory stimuli in macrophages and lung epithelial cells." 
"DUSP1 dephosphorylates mitogen activated protein kinases, which are evolutionary conserved enzymes that play an important role in orchestrating various cellular processes, including proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis." 
"We show that in HMC CTGF induces the rapid transcriptional activation and synthesis of MKP-1 (MAPK phosphatase-1), a dual specificity phosphatase that dephosphorylates p38 MAPK." 
"Using phospho specific antibodies and Western blotting, we determined that although DUSP1 could effectively dephosphorylate ERK, JNK and p38, wt DUSP26 does not exhibit DUSP activity towards these MAPKs in vitro (b)." 
"We next tested two other dual-specificity MAPK phosphatases : MKP1 and MKP5, which both de-phosphorylate Erk and p38 MAPK 30." 
"DUSP1 preferentially dephosphorylates activated p38 and JNK relative to ERK1/2 [XREF_BIBR]." 
"The results are consistent with findings by Chen et al. [XREF_BIBR], supporting the idea that MKP-1 plays a major role in dephosphorylation of activated JNK and p38 MAPK, but it only has minor effects on activated ERK." 
"Our previous report also revealed that MKP-1 only selectively de-phosphorylated gamma-radiation-mediated activation of JNK, but not ERK or p38." 
"For example, DUSP2 and DUSP9, which are known to dephosphorylate ERK, are at the bottom of the ranked list while other dual specificity phosphatase, DUSP13, which is not specific for ERK1/2, is towards the top indicating the possibility that ERK1/2 plays a dominant role in transmitting signals from IL-4R." 
"Subsequent kinetic analyses and transfection studies demonstrated that VHR specifically dephosphorylates and inactivates ERK1 and ERK2 in vitro and in vivo." 
"Immunodepletion of endogenous VHR eliminated the dephosphorylation of cellular ERK." 
"DUSP5 preferentially dephosphorylates ERK1/2 proteins and is involved in cell survival and inhibition of permeability." 
"ERK1/2 can be dephosphorylated by the inducible DUSP1, DUSP4, and DUSP5, which are found primarily in the nucleus, and by the cytosolic isoforms DUSP6, DUSP7, and DUSP9 (XREF_BIBR)." 
"These effects were associated with robust dephosphorylation of the actin depolymerizing factor cofilin by PP1 and PP2A serine/threonine protein phosphatases but not the cofilin specific phosphatases slingshot and chronophin." 
"In fact, the PP1 and PP2A inhibitor calyculin prevented cofilin dephosphorylation and restored motility." 
"Cofilin is dephosphorylated by PP1 and PP2A in response to FDH." 
"ALDH1L1 Inhibits Cell Motility Via Dephosphorylation of Cofilin by PP1 and PP2A." 
"Similarly, Chk1 itself is a component of the checkpoint termination machinery, in that dephosphorylation of the activated Chk1 mediated by PP1, PP2A, or PPM1D and Wip1 phosphatases promotes recovery from cell-cycle arrest (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR)." 
"Recent studies suggest that at least three mechanisms inactivate Chk1 in vertebrate cells : (1) SCF beta-Trcp1 -mediated degradation of Claspin, an essential mediator during the ATR induced Chk1 phosphorylation (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR); (2) dephosphorylation of activated Chk1 by PP1, PP2A, or PP2C type phosphatases (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR); and (3) Cul1 or Cul4A dependent degradation of Chk1, as described in this paper and elsewhere (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR)." 
"Previous studies have shown that the protein phosphatases PP1, PP2A, and PPM1D and Wip1 dephosphorylate activated Chk1 and promote termination of the checkpoint response [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR]." 
"During mitosis, Rb is dephosphorylated and thus activated by PP1." 
"Rb remains hyper-phosphorylated in M phase and is dephosphorylated by activation of the PP1 phosphatase as cells exit mitosis into the next early G 1 phase (XREF_BIBR)." 
"In proliferating cells, Rb phosphorylation status is controlled by the Cyclin Dependent Kinases (cdks) which phosphorylate Rb in response to growth stimulatory signals and Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1) which dephosphorylates Rb at the end of each M phase (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR)." 
"The enzyme protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), which is required for mitotic exit and is responsible for reversing the phosphorylation of many Cdk substrates, dephosphorylates Rb beginning in anaphase XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR." 
"However, in our study of the effect Rb phosphorylation on apoptosis, we utilized a siRNA method that activates PP1 phosphatase activity that causes dephosphorylation of Rb." 
"Since this is the time during mitosis when pRB is normally dephosphorylated [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR], it is tempting to speculate that prevention of pRB dephosphorylation by inhibiting PP1 activity impedes an orderly progression through mitosis, perhaps contributing towards a transformed phenotype." 
"Within cells, cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) phosphorylate Rb in response to growth stimulatory signals, whereas protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) dephosphorylates Rb when cells stop proliferating or undergo apoptosis in response to anti-proliferative or stress signals." 
"SHP2 dephosphorylates VE-cadherin–associated β-catenin in response to thrombin." 
"SHP2 dephosphorylates VE-cadherin-associated beta-catenin in response to thrombin." 
"However, given that adherens junction composition is not altered upon thrombin stimulation, how does beta-catenin dephosphorylation by SHP2 then affect VE-cadherin function?" 
"Tyrosine phosphorylation of beta-catenin is induced by PYK2 (proline rich kinase 2) [XREF_BIBR] and dephosphorylated by SHP2 [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Reconstitution of the endothelial barrier involves SHP2 mediated dephosphorylation of VE-cadherin-associated beta-catenin, leading to reassembly of adherens junctions and thereby closing the gaps between endothelial cells." 
"SHP2 dephosphorylates VE-cadherin-associated beta-catenin in response to thrombin" 
"Manes et al. reported that SHP-2 dephosphorylates FAK and increases cell migration by promoting turnover of focal adhesions in insulin like growth factor  (IGF)-1-stimulated MCF-7 cells." 
"Abrogation of SHP-2 catalytic activity with a dominant negative mutant (SHP2-C> S) abolishes IGF-I-induced FAK dephosphorylation, and cells expressing SHP2-C> S show reduced IGF-I-stimulated chemotaxis compared with either mock- or SHP-2 wild-type-transfected cells." 
"To further validate that SHP2 directly dephosphorylates FAK, we incubated MEF cell lysates expressing FLAG tagged FAK with purified GST-WT-PTP lacking the regulatory SH2 domains." 
"Manes et al. reported that SHP-2 dephosphorylates FAK and increases cell migration by promoting turnover of focal adhesions in insulin like growth factor (IGF)-1-stimulated MCF-7 cells." 
"While some studies have indicated SHP-2 promotes dephosphorylation of FAK, possibly to regenerate active FAK through a recycling mechanism (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR), others have shown that SHP-2 enhances phosphorylation and activation of FAK by inhibiting phosphorylation of the inhibitory tyrosine residue of Src family kinases by C-terminal Src family kinase (CSK) (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR)." 
"Another mechanism is an inhibition of STAT3 dephosphorylation by STAT3 RA in the nucleus." 
"In low passage LNCaP cells, activation of AKT represses AR transcription in reporter assays whereas the opposite is observed in high passage LNCaP cells." 
"Thus, A/R induced up-regulation of Akt mRNA level (as detected by Q-PCR) by approximately 1.5-fold (A)." 
"Most frequently, deregulation of AR is observed, as can be achieved through amplification of the AR gene locus, alternative mechanisms that induce high level AR gene expression, and/or mechanisms that induce AR protein stabilization." 
"In the former study, in which PIM-1S had no effect on AR transcriptional activity in a reporter assay, the experiments were performed under low androgen conditions (XREF_BIBR), whereas in the later study using a high concentration (10 nm) of synthetic androgen R1881, PIM-1S-mediated AR S213 phosphorylation repressed AR dependent transcription (XREF_BIBR)." 
"SIRT1 binds to, and deacetylates, the AR at a conserved lysine motif, down-regulating its levels in the cell and repressing androgen induced AR transcription (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR)." 
"Further, inhibition of AR also prevented the expression of AR protein in xenograft tissues (XREF_FIG)." 
"AR mediated resistance was associated with a failure to block ER transcriptional activity and enhanced up-regulation of AR and ER responsive gene expression." 
"Functionally, these AR isoforms are constitutively active and promote the expression of endogenous AR dependent genes, as well as the proliferation of 22Rv1 cells in a ligand independent manner." 
"A recent study showed expression of AR variants driven by AR gene rearrangements can mediate resistance to therapies targeting full-length AR, including enzalutamide (XREF_BIBR)." 
"CRPC usually possess a transcriptionally active AR that modulates the expression of AR regulated messenger RNAs XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR." 
"Recently, Sharma et al. have suggested that the progression to castration resistant prostate cancer is dependent on disruption of Rb which produces increased expression of the androgen receptor (AR) through the direct action of E2F1 (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Silencing of AR using shRNA reduced AR mRNA expression, and sensitized txr cells to taxol induced apoptosis and cell death." 
"We also showed that factors in the HS-5 bone marrow stromal cell (BMSC) conditioned medium can upregulate p62 in AR + PCa cell lines, leading us to investigate AR expression under those growth conditions." 
"AR mutations, which can broaden AR ligand specificity, and AR amplification, which can lead to AR protein overexpression, are two genomic mechanisms that can support the CRPCa phenotype (XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR)." 
"AR is known to auto-regulate its transcription [XREF_BIBR], and a decline of AR protein would be expected to cause an increase in AR transcription." 
"As shown in XREF_FIG, co-expression of WT AR and PIM1 repressed AR mediated transcription in a dose dependent manner." 
"For example, when cancer cell lines are cultured under hypoxic conditions, beta-catenin forms a complex with HIF-1 leading to hypoxia adaptation (XREF_BIBR), and in prostate cancer cells, a beta-catenin-androgen receptor (AR) complex increases the transcription of AR (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Further investigation of the mechanisms underlying Raf/MEK/ERK mediated AR downregulation may lead to the development of a novel means to control AR levels in PCa cells." 
"Therefore, one can expect that nutlin induced elevated MDM2 could also facilitate AR degradation and further reduce AR levels when combined with androgen ablation." 
"Ebp1 inhibited AR regulated transcription in these androgen independent cells." 
"We have previously established that Ebp1, a protein cloned in our laboratory via its interactions with the ErbB3 receptor, inhibits AR mediated transcription and growth of the AR positive LNCaP cell line (Zhang et al, 2002)." 
"In contrast, Gadd45alpha transcription was downregulated by ~ 20% (in the presence of exogenous BRCA1 and SUMO1 proteins or in the cells without either exogenous expression) to 35% (in the presence of exogenously expressed BRCA1 alone), when the level of BRCA1 was reduced by deletion of endogenous BRCA1 (XREF_FIG A)." 
"Here we demonstrate that BRCA1 plays an essential role in mediating vinorelbine induced apoptosis, as evidenced by (1) the strong correlation between vinorelbine sensitivity and BRCA1 expression level; (2) induction of resistance to vinorelbine by BRCA1 using siRNA oligonucleotides; (3) dramatic down-regulation of BRCA1 following selection for vinorelbine resistance; and (4) the re-activation of vinorelbine induced apoptosis following re-expression of BRCA1 in resistant cells." 
"Over-expression of either CtBP or BRCA1 caused bidirectional repression of transcription, suggesting that promoter and direction specific repression of BRCA1 transcription by CtBP and BRCA1 requires a structural chromatin context at the endogenous BRCA1 promoter that is not recapitulated by transiently transfected DNA constructs (XREF_FIG)." 
"This complex is disrupted by genotoxic stress resulting in the displacement of BRCA1 protein from the BRCA1 promoter and subsequent up-regulation of BRCA1 transcription." 
"This shows that BRCA1 negatively modulates Pol III gene transcription and the overexpression of BRCA1 decreases the induction of Pol III genes by alcohol." 
"Significantly, BRCA1 promoter and terminator interactions vary in different breast cancer cell lines, indicating that defects in BRCA1 chromatin structure may contribute to dysregulated expression of BRCA1 seen in breast tumors." 
"BRCA1 siRNA enabled us to study the effect of BRCA1 expression in the same background." 
"Breast cancer MCF-7 and T-47D cell were transfected with a vector containing the coding sequence of BRCA1 (pFlag-CMV2-BRCA1 wt) to induce BRCA1 overexpression or with the empty vector (control)." 
"Under these conditions, BRCA1 would be released from its promoter and recruited to sites of DNA repair allowing the now de-repressed BRCA1 promoter to increase BRCA1 transcription so that BRCA1 protein, consumed in the repair process, can be replaced." 
"Recent molecular evidence suggests that functional BRCA1 protein is necessary to induce expression of ER in breast cell progenitors (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR)." 
"This model explains how BRCA1 can both activate and repress ER-alpha transcription in hormone responsive tissues like breast and ovaries." 
"Preclinical models suggest that BRCA1 can transcriptionally induce ER gene expression and that loss of BRCA1 function is accompanied by loss of ER expression [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR]." 
"These results indicate that proper regulation of ER-alpha expression by pVHL or BRCA1 is important for MTOC regulation and prevention of chromosomal instability.HEK293, MCF-7, and MDA-MB-468 (DMEM) were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA)." 
"Contrary to previous reports, our study showed that E2F-1 activates RB expression in asynchronously growing cells." 
"Second, O-GlcNAc modification has been shown to be involved in repressing transcription in some systems (XREF_BIBR) and pRB represses E2F-1 mediated transcription (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Collectively, these data demonstrate that RB represses Pax8 mediated E2F1 transcription in thyroid cancer cells." 
"p21 positively regulates ERalpha dependent transcription via an interaction with CBP." 
"More importantly, we provide new evidence that ERalpha mediates proliferation of MCF-7 cells by up-regulating miR-17 to silence the expression of p21." 
"In contrast, in cell types exhibiting normal MEK and ERK status, mortalin overexpression suppressed B-Raf (V600E) - or DeltaRaf-1 : ER induced MEK and ERK activation, p21 (CIP1) expression, and cell cycle arrest." 
"beta-catenin expression and cells invasiveness ability were up-regulated by 17beta-estradiol (E 2) in an estrogen receptor (ESR)-dependent manner, whereas beta-catenin siRNA abrogated this phenomenon." 
"Other studies have shown that the ERalpha transcription complex includes beta-catenin and that beta-catenin coactivates ERalpha mediated transcription ()." 
"Our data implicated HOXB7 as a key ER cofactor that promotes ER target gene expression; which also could serve as yet another target in endocrine therapy." 
"Interestingly, insulin and ER stress inhibition (Tudca) were able to significantly reduce ER stress marker expression in MRAs from STZ mice (XREF_FIG)." 
"Treatment of the ERalpha negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 with 5-aza-2 '-deoxycytidine (AZA) was reported to reactivate ERalpha expression, and a synergistic induction of ERalpha expression was possible with the combination of AZA and trichostatin A (TSA; XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR)." 
"Over-expression of SnoN enhanced the transcriptional activity of ERalpha in estrogen response element (ERE)-reporter assays, augmented the expression of several ERalpha target genes and increased the proliferation of MCF7 breast carcinoma cells in an estrogen dependent manner." 
"In T47D cells, overexpression of wild-type ESR1 gene and protein increased growth in low-estradiol conditions, supporting the notion that by driving ESR1 overexpression, ESR1 gene amplification promotes adaptive resistance to estrogen deprivation (XREF_FIG)." 
"We showed that overexpression of wild-type ESR1 potently (about 3.6 times control vector) stimulated ESR1 mediated transcription in a concentration dependent fashion, while overexpression of Delta7 ESR1 failed to elicit a transcriptional response at any dose." 
"Overexpression of ERalpha can be caused by estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene amplification and was originally reported to be a frequent event associated with a significantly longer survival for ER positive women treated with adjuvant tamoxifen monotherapy, which was however questioned by subsequent studies." 
"And studies have suggested a potential role of ER in leukomogenesis because ER CpG island methylation at very high frequency caused inactivation of ER expression in human leukaemias." 
"Western blot showed that ERalpha expression levels in RAW264.7 cells were overexpressed by ERalpha plasmid transfection or suppressed by specific siRNA (A)." 
"Chronic ER stress in tumor cells increases the expression of the ER chaperones which provides a survival advantage to tumor cells in an adverse microenvironment." 
"6 Consistent with the conclusion that HDAC5 and -9 negatively regulate the expression of ERalpha in vivo, ERalpha expression was significantly upregulated in cardiac samples of both HDAC5 and -9 KO animals, whereas ERbeta expression levels were unchanged (XREF_FIG and data not shown)." 
"ESR1 gene promoter region methylation in free circulating DNA and its correlation with estrogen receptor protein expression in tumor tissue in breast cancer patients." 
"Briefly, by directly inhibiting proteosome activities, celastrol induced ER stress, activated CHOP and XBP1s, increased transcription of ER stress target genes such as BIM, induced Bax translocation into mitochondria and finally activated mitochondrial apoptosis." 
"Combined Suppression of PI3Kalpha and PDK1 Activates FOXO Dependent Transcription." 
"In that study, FoxO3a promoted cytosolic localization of FoxO1 by transcriptionally elevating expression of the PI3-kinase catalytic subunit in human embryonic kidney cells and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells XREF_BIBR; hence FoxO3a acted as a positive regulator of autophagy in those cell types." 
"Moreover, starvation induced increase in Sirt1 expression requires Foxo3a, and stimulation of Sirt1 expression by Foxo3a was mediated through physical interaction between Foxo3a and p53, which binds to two p53 binding sites present in the mouse Sirt1 promoter [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Consistent with FoxO3 up-regulation of Sirt1 expression, FoxO3 expression antagonizes NF-kappaB signaling [XREF_BIBR]." 
"In addition, expression of the Class III histone deacetylase Sirt1 is induced by E2F1 phosphorylated by the stress responsive kinase ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM), by p53 and FOXO3a (activated in nutrient deprived mammalian cells), by c-Myc and by the redox sensor carboxy terminal of E1A binding protein (CtBP) (reviewed in XREF_BIBR)." 
"Furthermore, SIRT1 can deacetylate P53 and FOXO and thereby inhibit P53 and/or FOXO dependent transcription or apoptosis." 
"Accordingly, hSir2 (SIRT1)-mediated deacetylation precludes FOXO inhibition through acetylation and thereby prolongs FOXO dependent transcription of stress regulating genes." 
"Furthermore, they found that stimulation of Sirt1 transcription by Foxo3a was mediated via a p53 binding site (two half sites) in the mouse Sirt1 promoter, and there was a nutrient sensitive physical interaction between Foxo3a and p53." 
"Stimulation of SIRT1 transcription by Foxo3a was mediated through two p53 binding sites present in the SIRT1 promoter, and a nutrient sensitive physical interaction was observed between Foxo3a and p53." 
"Thus, under nutritional stress, p53 and Foxo proteins promote SIRT1 expression, which serves as a protective mechanism against excessive apoptosis." 
"BRCA1 expression activated by c-Myc could be the final outcome of the interplay within multi-component transcriptional networks containing factors important for breast tumorigenesis." 
"c-Myc activates BRCA1 gene expression through distal promoter elements in breast cancer cells." 
"These data suggest that c-Myc activates BRCA1 expression through the E boxes in the distal BRCA1 promoter region." 
"Our studies revealed that BRCA1 represses Myc mediated transcription while having no effect on some other transcriptional activities." 
"Taken together, these data indicated that c-Myc activates BRCA1 expression through the region of the BRCA1 promoter (-1714 to +42), which could contain c-Myc-mediated DNA regulatory elements." 
"Intriguingly, MYC induces expression of BRCA1 [XREF_BIBR] and also of astrocyte elevated gene-1 (AEG-1) [XREF_BIBR]." 
"In this report we show that c-Myc can activate BRCA1 expression in breast cancer cells, and depletion of c-Myc reduced BRCA1 dependent DNA repair." 
"These data suggest that reduced c-Myc might decrease BRCA1 expression in these two breast cancer cell lines through the BRCA1 promoter." 
"Whether c-Myc can directly regulate BRCA1 expression at the transcriptional level is not clear." 
"To establish that BRCA1 expression was directly modulated by c-Myc through DNA regulatory elements in the BRCA1 promoter region, we constructed a BRCA1 promoter and luciferase reporter vector containing the BRCA1 promoter region -1714 to +42." 
"It has been shown that HIF-1alpha transcriptional machinery activated by hypoxia signaling pathway abrogates c-Myc activation of BRCA1 expression in colon cancer cells [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Both c-Myc RNAi and AR RNAi reduced expression of the c-Myc-activated gene E2F1; conversely, c-Myc and AR RNAi both increased expression of the c-Myc-repressed gene CDKN1A (XREF_FIG)." 
"Since c-Myc is a potent transcriptional repressor of p21, these findings suggest that c-Myc may negatively modulate p21 expression through an additional pathway except transcriptional suppression." 
"Similarly, p21 represses MYC dependent transcription and in turn, MYC disrupts the PCNA-p21 interaction, thus alleviating p21 dependent inhibition of PCNA and DNA synthesis 14." 
"Either c-myc release from the complexes or interaction others with Miz-1 may activate p21 transcription." 
"As expected, c-Myc knockdown by siRNA decreased the expression of cyclin D1, cyclin E, and E2F1, and increased the expression of p21 Cip1 (XREF_FIG), leading to impaired CAFs proliferation (XREF_FIG)." 
"Secondly, DLX4 induced c-myc expression might lead to down-regulated expression of p15 Ink4B and p21 WAF1 and Cip1, since transcription of these genes is repressed by c-myc (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR)." 
"c-Myc binds to these E-boxes through heterodimer formation with Max proteins and directly activates the hTERT transcription." 
"In the absence of TGF-beta, c-Myc associated with E-box sequences of hTERT promoter to activate hTERT expression in immortalized cells in this study (D, left panel)." 
"Many repeats of hTERT-VNTR2-1 st include the canonical CACGTG binding site of the MYC family of oncogenic transcription factors, that is also present in the promoter region; overexpression of c-MYC activates hTERT transcription through this promoter element [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR]." 
"Hence, c-Myc upregulates telomerase by enhancing hTERT expression [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR]." 
"We previously showed that MYC recruits the STAGA complex to activate transcription of the endogenous TERT gene in HeLa cervical cancer cells and that the activation mechanisms are distinct from a simple stimulation of histone acetylation (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Previous studies showed that MYC activated hTERT transcription through binding to the E-boxes at the hTERT promoter in some cancer cells (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR)." 
"Because c-Myc can activate transcription of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene (hTERT), we addressed the role of BRCA1 and Nmi in modulating c-Myc-induced hTERT promoter activity." 
"Direct activation of TERT transcription by c-MYC." 
"Therefore, these results indicate that the increase of telomere length observed in previous studies may not just depend on the activation of telomerase transcription by c-Myc." 
"Direct activation of TERT transcription by c-Myc." 
"Further, MAD1 is also a transcription repressor of hTERT that binds to its 5 '-CACGTG-3 ' sequence (E-box), while c-MYC binds to the same promoter sites to activate hTERT expression (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR)." 
"c-Myc overexpression activated the wildtype, but not the mutant, hTERT promoter, despite of the presence of numerous potential c-Myc binding sites downstream of the promoter in the mutant BACs (XREF_BIBR), indicating that activation of hTERT transcription by c-Myc was mediated only by the E-box sites at core promoter." 
"While hTERT activation by c-Myc overexpression has been previously reported, it was a surprise to discover that c-Myc and Max KD also activated hTERT transcription in a chromosomal context in fibroblasts." 
"Finally, Myc activates the transcription of human telomerase (), which may contribute to sustain the proliferation of tumor cells along the cell cycle." 
"Thus, some cases of intestinal metaplasia may carry short telomeres and due to this telomere dysfunction, MYC stimulates hTERT expression." 
"Moreover, earlier reported studies have found that MMP-9 silencing could induce down-regulation of hTERT expression mediated by beta1 integrin and FAK intracellular signaling deregulation of c-Myc and MAD expression in glioma xenograft cells." 
"Mutant p53 expression in U251 cells was dependent upon endogenous MYC, because knockdown of MYC suppressed p53 expression (XREF_FIG)." 
"This effect was preceded and mediated by down-regulation of MYC, which enhances p53 protein levels via the ARF-HDM2 pathway." 
"On the other hand, p53 represses c-Myc transcription by binding to the c-Myc promoter and recruiting the general repressor mSin3a; this repression is required for cell cycle arrest and differentiation but not apoptosis [XREF_BIBR]." 
"These data suggest that p53 represses c-myc transcription through a mechanism that involves histone deacetylation." 
"Blocking c-Myc induction in HuH-7 cells prevented the LCA mediated increase in p53 and cyclin D1 expression and reduced apoptosis." 
"The expression level of another pro apoptotic protein, p53, was also up-regulated in AU565 and SKBR3 cells treated with CDK1 inhibitors and MYC knockdown prevented increase of p53 expression by CDK1 inhibitors (Additional file XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY : Figure S5B), whereas MYC overexpression in MCF-7 cells and MDA-MB-175 cells (Additional file XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY : Figure S5B) induced p53 expression upon treatment with CDK1 inhibitors." 
"c-Myc activates the expression of p53 through an E box within the p53 promoter [XREF_BIBR]." 
"In addition, mutant TP53 knockdown induced a dramatic decrease of MGMT expression (P = 0.0000034)." 
"The tumor suppressor p53 is reported to suppress MGMT expression either by directly binding to MGMT or by sequestering specificity protein 1 (SP1), a transcription factor which binds to the MGMT promoter." 
"In contrast, ionizing radiation induced MGMT expression in normal rodent fibroblasts and hepatoma cells is greater in wild-type p53 cells than in p53 mutated cells, suggesting that p53 positively regulate MGMT transcription in cells treated with a DNA damaging agent." 
"In addition, a recent report showed that p53 knockout or RNA interference of p53 reduces MGMT expression in murine astrocytes." 
"Although several glioma studies have demonstrated correlations between inactivation of the p53 pathway and lower levels and/or activity of MGMT [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR], the introduction of wild type p53 failed to restore MGMT protein levels in transformed NHA cells." 
"Additionally, wild-type p53, rather than mutant p53, promotes MGMT expression by modulating MGMT methylation by reducing DNMT1 expression in lung cancer cell lines [XREF_BIBR], while transduction of IMR90 fibroblasts (human fetal lung cells) with a wild-type p53-adenoviral vector reduced MGMT expression [XREF_BIBR]." 
"In order to investigate if abnormal p53 protein is capable to induce MGMT expression, we transfected plasmids encoding for GFP (pEGFP-N1), wild type p53 (pP53wt) or a dominant negative mutant p53 (pP53mut) into MeWo cells." 
"Surprisingly, knockdown of p53 dramatically suppressed MGMT mRNA expression in A549 cells, whereas overexpression of WT-p53 in H1299 cells significantly increased MGMT mRNA levels (a)." 
"These results clearly indicate that WT-p53 promotes MGMT transcription by modulating MGMT promoter methylation.DNMT1 and HDAC1 play a crucial role in gene silencing via promoter methylation." 
"It appears that in astrocytes, p53 positively modulate MGMT expression directly by binding to its promoter." 
"This negative regulation of MGMT expression by WT-p53 has been confirmed with two other human cell lines, namely, the GM47.23 glioblastoma cell line, which contains a dexamethasone inducible p53, and the H460 lung cancer cell line, in which WT-p53 is inactivated by the human papillomavirus 16 E6 protein." 
"Interestingly, p53 appears to stimulate MGMT expression, and p53 inhibition sensitizes human glioma cells to TMZ [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR]." 
"On the contrary, some reports suggest that p53 may positively regulate MGMT expression, and that p53 inhibition sensitizes human glioma cells to TMZ [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR]." 
"Additionally, wild-type p53 rather than mutant p53 promoted MGMT expression by modulating MGMT methylation, presumably by reducing DNMT1 (DNA-methyltransferase 1) expression in lung cancer cell lines [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Because dimer formation between mutant and wild type p53 increases p53 stability and inactivates wtp53 XREF_BIBR, increased p73 levels in these cells suggest that p53 inactivation by point mutation may also induce p73 expression." 
"To further demonstrate the specific role of E2F-1 in p53 inactivation regulated p73 transcription, we tested whether mutation of E2F binding sites abolishes p53 inactivation mediated upregulation of p73 transcription." 
"We found that inactivation of p53 in MCF-7 and HCT-116 cells resulted in increased expression of TAp73, but not DNp73, which suggests that p53 inactivation-mediated-upregulation of p73 may contribute to the p73 overexpression detected in human cancers." 
"In addition to p53 knockdown and knockout, we found that inactivation of p53 by overexpression of mtp53 (G135A) led to p73 upregulation, indicating that p53 inactivation by means other than deletion and knockdown also induce p73 expression." 
"These data suggest that p53 inactivation upregulated p73 transcription, which was independent of p53 binding." 
"Based on our evidence showing that p53 inactivation upregulates p73 transcription, one would expect a decrease of p73 expression in the cells transfected with wtp53." 
"Hence, our results not only address how p53 inactivation upregulates p73 transcription in a DNA binding independent manner but also underscores the role of pRb and E2F -1 pathway in the regulation of p73 expression." 
"Because E2F-1 is a major transcription factor that regulates TAp73 transcription and there are multiple E2F binding sites in the proximal promoter region XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, we reasoned that modulation of E2F-1 activity might play a role in p53 inactivation mediated upregulation of p73 transcription." 
"These include dimers between certain p53 mutants and p73 that downregulates p73 activity XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR; a potential interaction between p53 and the p73 promoter at the distal region XREF_BIBR; p53 mediated induction of oncogenic DNp73; and our finding that p53 inactivation upregulates p73 transcription." 
"p53 inactivation upregulates p73 transcription through E2F-1." 
"Taken together, our results reveal that p53 inactivation may upregulate TAp73 expression through E2F-1 mediated transcriptional regulation, which involves modulated p21 activity." 
"p53 Inactivation Upregulates p73 Expression through E2F-1 Mediated Transcription." 
"These results demonstrate that modulation of E2F activity plays a critical role in p53 inactivation mediated upregulation of p73 transcription." 
"Also, p63 and p73 have overlapping functions to p53 and can regulate p53 gene transcription." 
"Using several p53 inactivation models we demonstrated that inactivation of p53 upregulated TAp73 expression." 
"Although less p53 induction was observed in TP53 mutant Daoy cells, increased TP73 levels including DeltaN ' p73 were detected." 
"Functionally, p73, a family member of p53, activates transcription of p21- and p53 responsive genes, which participate in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and apoptosis and inhibits cell growth in a p53 like manner by inducing apoptosis or G1 cell cycle arrest XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR." 
"When activated, p73 signals transcription of p53 responsive genes, thereby acting as a tumor suppressor." 
"p73 activates transcription of p21- and p53 responsive genes, which participate in cell cycle control, DNA repair, apoptosis and inhibits cell growth in a p53 like manner by inducing apoptosis or G1 cell cycle arrest XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR." 
"Particularly, p53 binds to a palindromic site in the TAp73 promoter, activates the promoter of TAp73, and selectively induces TAp73 transcription." 
"The full length transcriptionally active form of p73 (TAp73) is normally found in the nucleus and can induce the transcription of downstream p53 target genes." 
"On the other hand p73 can activate the transcription of p53 responsive genes [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Since the p53 related transcription factors p63 and p73 can modulate p53 functions and activate the transcription of some p53 target genes XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, we examined the impact at the FLT1 promoter alleles using gene reporter assays and ectopic expression of p53 or of selected p63 and p73 isoforms." 
"It was also reported that overexpression of p53 or p73 induced p73 transcription in certain cell lines XREF_BIBR." 
"Inactivation of FOXO3a by AKT was essential for neuroblastoma cell survival." 
"Akt inactivates FoxO3a which in turn influences ER expression." 
"However, given that FoxO3a is inactivated by AKT in proliferating cells, it was puzzling that SOD2 expression was maintained in proliferating cells (A-S2C, 1, 6 and 9)." 
"The mechanism for this resistance involves inactivation of FoxO3a by Akt which down-regulates cav-1 expression (XREF_FIG)." 
"Furthermore, constitutively active Akt1 has been reported to suppress ERK activity downstream of Raf and MEK and independent of ERK phosphorylation (XREF_BIBR)." 
"In contrast, Akt1 mutant cells do not show any appreciable increase in phosphorylation of Erk1 and Erk2 compared to PIK3CA knock in clones (XREF_FIG)." 
"Consistently, recombinant Akt1 strongly phosphorylated immunoprecipitated Myc tagged DLC1, S298A, and S329A but not S567A ()."

"Indeed, phosphorylation of the N-terminal serine 9 residue, a negative regulation site, of GSK3beta by Akt and PKB, is important for the inhibition of GSK3beta during insulin dependent glycogen synthesis and neuronal survival mediated through Akt." 
"Akt decreased ASK1 kinase activity stimulated by both oxidative stress and overexpression in 293 cells by phosphorylating a consensus Akt site at serine 83 of ASK1." 
"In this report, we demonstrate that Akt1, but not Akt2, down-regulated the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway by phosphorylating c-Raf on Ser259." 
"The expression of phosphorylated mTOR (p-mTOR), phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT), p85alpha and p110gamma subunits of PI3K, phosphorylated p70S6K (p-p70S6K), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and phosphorylated 4E-BP1 (p-4E-BP1) was examined by immunohistochemistry in 102NSCLC specimens." 
"To investigate whether HCA 2 -induced p70S6K1 phosphorylation is mediated by ERK1/2 activation or Akt activation, U0126, a highly selective inhibitor of both MEK1 and MEK2, and Wortmannin, a highly selective inhibitor of PI3K, were analyzed for their effect on the activation of p70S6K1." 
"While SIRT2 overexpression in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes and HeLa cells enhanced insulin induced Akt activation and phosphorylation of its downstream targets GSK3beta and p70S6 kinase, pharmacological or genetic SIRT2 inhibition causes the opposite effect." 
"Activation of mTOR in response to nutrients and growth factors results in the phosphorylation of numerous substrates, including the phosphorylations of S6 kinase by mTORC1 and Akt by mTORC2." 
"The depletion of Akt diminished the phosphorylation of mTOR and S6 in the infected cells (A)." 
"Inhibition of Akt by treatment with Akt inhibitor VIII attenuated phosphorylation of both Foxo3a and the mTORC1 target S6 kinase, as well as prevented inhibition of autophagy by IGF1 (XREF_FIG)." 
"Activation of Akt in RPE-hTERT cells or insulin treatment of immortalised MEFs only slightly increased the levels of S6 phosphorylation." 
"Mounting evidence has established the classical way of Akt1 (Ser473) in rpS6 activation [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR], but nevertheless the Akt independent phosphorylation of rpS6 was also reported [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR]." 
"Several studies have found that rpS6 is phosphorylated by Akt1 (Ser473) approach in colorectal and bladder cancer cells [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR], but there are also reports revealing the Akt independent phosphorylation of rpS6 [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR]." 
"Hence, although AKT may modestly contribute to rpS6 phosphorylation, its contribution is substantially less than what is observed following inhibition of BRAF V600E --> MEK1/2 --> ERK1/2 or PI3 '-kinase signaling." 
"IR is known to mediate a rapid activation of Akt [XREF_BIBR] and recent studies showed that ATM can function as an activating Akt kinase that phosphorylates rapidly Akt-S473 [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Whereas mTORC2 directly phosphorylates AKT, activated p70S6K phosphorylates and negatively regulates insulin receptor substrate 1.13 As insulin receptor substrate 1 is an important upstream activator of PI3K-AKT, phosphorylation of p70S6K, thus, evokes a physiological negative feedback loop toward AKT.5 Phosphorylation of AKT at Ser 473 was slightly attenuated in 3T3 cells expressing active mTOR mutants compared with that in those expressing the wild-type protein, consistent with a previous observation.8 Transforming activity of mTOR mutants is rapamycin sensitive." 
"Thus, src family tyrosine kinases are important regulators of Akt signalling in infection.-induced EGFR activation mediates Akt Ser473 phosphorylation in several cell lines ()." 
"According to our current findings, this model has to be extended by the Akt pathway.Phosphorylation of Akt at serine 473 results in the activation of Akt ()." 
"As shown in XREF_FIG, overexpressing miR-519a significantly increased, but silencing miR-519a decreased, the Akt activity and the expression of phosphorylated Akt (Ser473) in HCC cells (P < 0.05)." 
"PDK1 XREF_BIBR phosphorylates AKT at T308, and mTORC2 XREF_BIBR as well as other potential PDK2s phosphorylates AKT at S473." 
"In the case of AKT, the interaction of the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of AKT with membrane bound PIP 3 confers a conformational change in AKT which allows PDK1 to phosphorylate AKT at residue threonine 308 (XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR)." 
"Furthermore, upstream overexpression or knockdown of Akt2 or Akt2 phosphorylation inhibition, rather than Akt1 or Akt3, resulted in striking hyperphosphorylation or dephosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K and rpS6 (all P < 0.05), without any change in total proteins expressions." 
"On the other hand, phosphorylation of PGC-1alpha by AKT and protein kinase B (PKB), downstream of insulin signaling in the liver, is known to decrease its stability and transcriptional activity (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Because HST has been described to block EGF and EGFR- induced Akt and PKB phosphorylation and proliferation in vitro [20], the previously mentioned findings could be interpreted as an attempt by the HST positive cancer cells to block Akt and PKB phosphorylation." 
"Akt inhibition with LY294002 strongly diminished the phosphorylation of Akt and its downstream target 4E-BP1 in all five mesothelioma cell lines and control LP9 cells (XREF_FIG)." 
"AKT inhibitors either compete for the catalytic ATP binding site of AKT or block phosphorylation of AKT in allosteric fashion [XREF_BIBR]."

"Several targets of p-AKT, such as BAD, MDM2 and FOXO1, contain the RXXS motif and are phosphorylated by p-AKT [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR] (XREF_TABLE)." 
"AKT overexpression completely prevented PEITC induced suppression of AKT phosphorylation." 
"It was observed that Akt substantially increased the level of 5-HT-induced Akt phosphorylation in Du145 cells and, to lesser extent in, PC-3 cells, but not in LNCaP cells." 
"Furthermore, expression of dominant negative Akt abrogated endogenous Akt activity, Rab3D phosphorylation and GAG synthesis, whereas expression of constitutively activated Akt stimulated Rab3D phosphorylation and GAG synthesis in the absence of PDGF-BB." 
"XREF_BIBR) (Akt inhibitors that suppress Akt activation processes including Akt-Ser473 phosphorylation), wortmannin or LY294002 (the inhibitors of PI3K upstream of Akt) reduced both Plk1-Ser99 phosphorylation and the interaction between Plk1 and 14-3-3gamma (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY)." 
"Analyses of AKT kinase inhibitors have shown that acute AKT inhibition causes a paradoxical increase of AKT phosphorylation, probably through a negative feedback loop." 
"In contrast, MDA-MB-231 cells expressing either helical domain or kinase domain p110alpha mutants showed elevated basal levels of Akt phosphorylation as well as enhanced EGF stimulated Akt phosphorylation." 
"Insulin stimulates phosphorylation of Akt and activated Akt exerts various biological effects such as cell growth and survival, angiogenesis, and metabolism by regulating downstream effectors [XREF_BIBR]." 
"We found that the addition of trastuzumab did not inhibit the already low level of HER2 phosphorylation or further diminish the minimally detectable HER3 phosphorylation in these cells, nor did it further decrease PI3K-Akt signaling through Akt or S6 phosphorylation." 
"The data presented here show that c48/80 : i) at low doses (up to 10mug/ml) augments serum induced phosphorylation of PKB and p70 in a manner sensitive to both PI 3-kinase and PKC inhibitors, ii) at higher doses induces the phosphorylation of p70 and the translocation of PKCalpha in a PI 3-kinase dependent fashion, but inhibits the phosphorylation of PKB." 
"We first show that this dominant negative Akt (DN-Akt) eliminates Akt phosphorylation in response to Insulin Growth Factor in cells transfected with DN-Akt compared to empty vector (XREF_FIG)." 
"Acetylation blocked binding of Akt and PDK1 to PIP (3), thereby preventing membrane localization and phosphorylation of Akt." 
"In addition, we sought to analyze other biologically relevant, cancer related proteins, including downstream targets of PI3K signaling, such as phosphorylated Akt (p-Akt), mTOR (p-mTOR), and S6 ribosomal protein (p-S6)." 
"These observations establish that TCL1 functions as an Akt kinase coactivator, which enhances the phosphorylation and activation of Akt in vivo.We next studied the biological effects of the TCL1 and Akt interaction in vivo.Transient transfection of TCL1 into the 293 cell line resulted in a 10-fold increase of proliferative responses (, lane 2)."

"The reduced AKT activation in MCF-7PIK3CAWT cells in turn caused greatly reduced phosphorylation of known AKT target proteins, including PRAS40, FOXO 1/3, and AS160." 
"This notion was supported by the evidence that overexpression of the PH domain of Akt inhibited endogenous Akt phosphorylation, whereas the Akt PH domain mutant retaining the PI (3,4,5) P3 binding did not." 
"These results suggest that GRP induces c-Src dependent Akt phosphorylation but EGF stimulates Akt phosphorylation directly, without involvement of c-Src." 
"Furthermore, inhibiting Akt activation using the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 completely prevented EPO+IGFI-I-induced Akt phosphorylation and GSK-3beta phosphorylation compared to control (see XREF_FIG), confirming the involvement of the PI3K/Akt/GSK-3beta pathway." 
"Active recombinant Akt readily phosphorylated Bmi1, but not a Bmi1 S316A mutant protein (XREF_FIG), and expression of a constitutively active form of Akt (myristoylated Akt) in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells resulted in phosphorylation of Bmi1 (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY) (XREF_BIBR)." 
"These compounds inhibited Akt activation and phosphorylation of several downstream substrates of Akt in tumor cells without affecting the activities of upstream kinases (such as PI3-K and 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1, also known as PDPK1), or members of other signaling pathways such as ERK2."

"Both the PI3K and AKT and RAS and MAPK signal transduction pathways mediate 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, releasing 4E-BP1 from the mRNA cap and permitting translation initiation." 
"Thus, both RAS and MAPK and PI3K and AKT signaling mediate phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, thereby disengaging the protein from the mRNA cap and disinhibiting translation (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR)." 
"Akt phosphorylation decreases the ability of TSC2 to inhibit the phosphorylation of ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E binding protein-1 (4EBP1), which are mTOR substrates." 
"As expected, the inhibition of PI3K and Akt through LY294002 (20muM) and Akti1/2 (2muM), respectively, and Akt depletion using specific siRNA abrogated the -induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and prevented de-phosphorylation of eEF2 (C, D; Supplementary Fig. 1)." 
"Given the convergence of RAS and MAPK and PI3K and AKT signaling that mediates phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 may prove to be an effective strategy to improve treatment outcome in patients with metastatic melanoma." 
"In contrast, in tumor cells with coexistent KRAS and PIK3CA mutations (HCT116), inhibition of neither AKT nor MEK was sufficient to rapidly inhibit phosphorylation of p70S6K, S6, or 4E-BP1 at any of its four phosphorylation sites, although modest inhibition was observed after exposure to the MEK inhibitor for 24 h. However, combined inhibition of MEK and AKT synergistically inhibited phosphorylation of all these sites 6 h after drug exposure and profoundly by 12 h (XREF_FIG)."

"Ionizing radiation resulted in src kinase stabilization, activation and subsequent src mediated caveolin-1 Y14- and EGFR Y845-phosphorylations." 
"These results demonstrate that CLEC-2 regulates GSK3alpha and beta phosphorylation downstream of Akt, ERK, and PKC, thus enhancing platelet activation." 
"In each cell line, we observed increased AKT phosphorylation at both S473 and T308 following AZD6244 treatment, as well as increased phosphorylation of several AKT targets including GSK3alpha and beta, ATP citrate lyase, and PRAS40 (XREF_FIG)."

"Alternatively, GSK-3 could directly stimulate IRS-1 phosphorylation and degradation." 
"Augmented serine phosphorylation of IRS-1 can also increase degradation of the protein (XREF_BIBR) and it is possible that GSK-3alpha is phosphorylating and targeting a specific pool of IRS-1 toward the degradative pathway." 
"GSK-3 is known for inactivating glycogen synthase and participates in the Wnt signaling pathway to phosphorylate beta-catenin; GSK-3 can be inhibited by Akt phosphorylation, which is part of insulin signal transduction."

"The inhibition of GSK3beta suppresses the phosphorylation of beta-catenin at S33, ultimately resulting in its cytoplasmic accumulation." 
"This correlates with the fact that Wnt signaling primarily inhibits beta-catenin phosphorylation at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 by GSK3 but not Ser45 phosphorylation by CK1 XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR; (iv) finally we found that injection of a phosphorylated PPPSPXS peptide, but not the mutant PPPAPXA peptide, into Xenopus embryos is able to induce axis duplication and the expression of Xnr3, a Wnt and beta-catenin target gene (XREF_FIG), consistent with the notion that phosphorylated PPPSPXS inhibits GSK3 in vivo." 
"Following casein kinase 1 mediated phosphorylation of beta-catenin at serine 45, GSK3beta phosphorylates beta-catenin at Thr 41, Ser 33, and Ser 37, which tags beta-catenin for ubiquitination by betaTrCP and proteomic degradation." 
"This inhibitory effect of phosphorylated PPPSPXS motifs is direct and specific for GSK3 phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Ser33/Ser37/Thr41 but not for CK1 phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Ser45, and is independent of Axin function." 
"GSK-3beta phosphorylates cytosolic beta-catenin at Ser 33, Ser 37, and Thr 41 prior to beta-catenin degradation, but phosphorylation of GSK-3beta at Ser 9 inhibits its kinase activity." 
"Although CK1 is known to be required as a priming kinase for GSK-3beta phosphorylation of beta-catenin in vivo (), in vitro beta-catenin can be directly phosphorylated at S33, S37, and T41 residues by GSK-3beta without priming by CK1 () ()." 
"In non stimulated cells, the protein level of free beta-catenin is kept low by a so called destruction complex consisting mainly of the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) and Axin, which build a scaffold on which the serine/threonine kinases casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) function to phosphorylate beta-catenin on N-terminal residues Ser 45 (CK1alpha) and Ser 33, Ser 37, and Thr 41 (GSK3beta) [XREF_BIBR]."

"In addition to disruption of VE-cadherin and beta-catenin complexes, treatment of vascular EC with apo (a) attenuates the phosphorylation of beta-catenin at Ser 33,-37/Thr-41 by GSK-3beta (XREF_FIG), thus causing a decrease in the degradation of cytoplasmic beta-catenin." 
"Furthermore, in vitro kinase assay depicted that GSK-3beta phosphorylates ERalpha at Ser 118." 
"Physiologic GSK-3 inactivation using conditional AKT (CA-AKT-ER), which avoids potential non specific effects of chemical GSK-3 inhibitors, induced hyper-phosphorylation of GSK-3 and inhibited the growth of HOXA9 and MEIS1 cells (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY)." 
"It is unknown whether this regulation of MDM2 involves a preferential PKB isozyme.Secondly, active PKB mediates GSK3 phosphorylation and inhibition of GSK3 activity." 
"Reduction of GSK-3 protein levels, either by RNA interference or by disruption of the mouse GSK-3beta gene, causes increased N-terminal phosphorylation of GSK-3, confirming that GSK-3 regulates its own phosphorylation status." 
"Phosphorylation mediated inhibition of GSK-3 is not limited to Akt and other protein kinases such as protein kinase A (PKA) and protein kinase C (PKC) also phosphorylate GSK-3." 
"Moreover, a selective PKCb inhibitor, LY379196, reduced NT mediated GSK-3b (but not GSK-3a) phosphorylation, suggesting a role for PKCb1 in the NT mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3b and an undefined kinase in the NT mediated phosphorylation of GSK-3a." 
"Phosphorylation of c-Myc on T58 by GSK3 regulates the binding of Fbw7, which in turn triggers c-Myc ubiquitination and degradation [XREF_BIBR]."

"Mechanistic analyses indicated that RhoB facilitated nuclear accumulation of GSK-3 and GSK-3-mediated phosphorylation of c-Myc T58, the critical site for ubiquitination and degradation of c-Myc." 
"Phosphorylation of c-Myc on T58, which is catalyzed by GSK3 beta kinase, is necessary for activating the ubiquitin and proteasome pathway to destroy c-Myc protein." 
"Conversely, when LANA is eliminated from PEL cells using RNA interference, GSK-3beta-mediated c-Myc T58 phosphorylation is restored." 
"Here we show that inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity with lithium increases c-Myc stability and inhibits phosphorylation of c-Myc specifically at Thr 58 in vivo." 
"Small inhibitory RNA induced silencing of GSK3beta prevents phosphorylation of MYC on T58, thereby inhibiting recognition of MYC by the E3 ubiquitin ligase component FBW7." 
"A recent study has shown that GSK3 phosphorylates the turn motif of p70S6K and cooperates with mTOR to control the activity of p70S6K and cell proliferation (XREF_BIBR), thus providing a rationale for co-targeting mTOR and GSK3 to treat diseases such as cancer." 
"GSK3beta inactivation in podocytes results in decreased phosphorylation of p70S6K accompanied by cytoskeletal rearrangements and inhibited motility."

"Non-activated Smad3 can also be phosphorylated in its MH1 domain by GSK3-β in association with the scaffolding protein Axin." 
"To directly demonstrate that GSK3 mediated the Smad linker phosphorylation induced by riluzole, melanoma cell lines were treated with riluzole, in the absence or presence of pharmacological inhibitors of GSK3, LiCl and CT99021." 
"Because we have demonstrated that GSK3 is involved in the phosphorylation of two downstream effectors of transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta), Smad2 and Smad3, at their linker domain, our aim was to determine whether riluzole could induce GSK3beta mediated linker phosphorylation of Smad2 and Smad3." 
"In this melanoma cell line, like in the others, GSK3 mediated the riluzole induced Smad linker phosphorylation." 
"In addition, in vitro kinase assays confirmed that GSK3beta could phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 at the cluster of serines 245/250/255 and serine 204 respectively." 
"Together, these data demonstrate that both AMPK and GSK3 phosphorylate TSC2 in a coordinated manner.Next, we addressed whether AMPK and GSK3 depend on each other to repress mTOR pathway." 
"discovered that GSK-3 functions as a priming kinase in assisting AMPK to phosphorylate and activate TSC2." 
"These results suggest that phosphorylation of TSC2 by GSK3 increases the ability of TSC2 to inhibit mTOR signaling.Previously, we found that mTOR activity contributed to cell apoptosis under glucose starvation ()." 
"showed that TSC2 was coimmunoprecipitated with GSK3  (), lending additional support to our hypothesis that TSC2 could be a direct substrate of GSK3.We investigated whether GSK3 phosphorylates TSC2 on the predicted sites and whether this requires AMPK priming phosphorylation." 
"We found that GSK3 phosphorylated TSC2 only when TSC2 had been previously phosphorylated by AMPK (B)." 
"We proposed that phosphorylation of TSC2 by GSK3 after the AMPK priming phosphorylation enhances the ability of TSC2 to inhibit mTOR signaling."

"It has been suggested that GSK3 can inhibit the mTOR pathway by phosphorylating TSC2 in a manner dependent on AMPK priming phosphorylation (XREF_BIBR)." 
"GSK-3beta phosphorylates and activates TSC2, which in turn inhibits mTOR 11, where GSK-3beta is required for mTOR regulation by energy starvation 11." 
"We propose that AMPK and GSK3 coordinately phosphorylate TSC2 and depend on each other to repress mTOR signaling ()." 
"These data demonstrate that TSC2 phosphorylation by GSK3 is important for mTOR inhibition and, consequently, cell viability in response to energy starvation.The functional importance of TSC2 phosphorylation by GSK3 in the Wnt signaling was also investigated." 
"This is a mechanism of action analogous to that observed for AMPK mediated mTOR inhibition, and it appears that the phosphorylation of TSC2 by GSK-3beta is dependent on prior phosphorylation of the substrate by AMPK at the S1345 residue (XREF_BIBR)." 
"If GSK3 phosphorylates TSC2 following the AMPK priming phosphorylation, then inhibition of GSK3 should compromise AMPK induced TSC2 phosphorylation." 
"To confirm that GSK3 phosphorylates TSC2 on the predicted sites in vivo, we performed two-dimensional mapping analyses for TSC2 mutants in the presence of kinase-inactive GSK3-KD and 2DG." 
"The role of GSK3 phosphorylation of TSC2 in cellular energy response was investigated." 
"These observations lend additional support to our hypothesis that Wnt inhibits the GSK3 dependent phosphorylation of TSC2, although Mak etal." 
"Therefore, our studies demonstrating the coordinated phosphorylation of TSC2 by AMPK and GSK3 provide a clear mechanism to explain how different signaling pathways are integrated ata molecular level.It is worth noting that TSC2 is also phosphorylated by other kinases, including Akt, MK2, CDK, ERK, and RSK1." 
"Although mechanisms by which Wnt signaling regulates gene transcription have been extensively studied, little knowledge exists as to whether Wnt signaling also regulates protein translation.Here we report that TSC2 is a physiological substrate of GSK3 and that Wnt stimulates the mTOR signaling pathway via inhibiting GSK3 phosphorylation of TSC2." 
"A recent study suggested that IR upregulates alphavbeta3 expression in ECs and consecutively phosphorylates AKT (Ser 473), which may provide a tumor escape mechanism from radiation injury mediated by integrin survival signaling (XREF_BIBR)." 
"IR increased the levels of NBS1 and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt Ser 473) in two different cell lines (XREF_FIG)." 
"In HCT 116 cells IR did not induce an immediate Akt phosphorylation (C and D) as it is apparent in A549 cells (see)." 
"In the response of insulin, insulin receptor (IR) phosphorylates insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins, which are linked to the activation of two main signaling pathways : the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt/protein kinase B (PKB) pathway, which is responsible for the majority of the metabolic actions of insulin, and the Ras-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway, which regulates the expression of some genes and cooperates with the PI3K pathway to control cell growth and differentiation XREF_BIBR."

"We found that PTEN deficient cells displayed a normal DNA damage response (DDR) as evidenced by the ionizing radiation (IR)-induced phosphorylation of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated (ATM) as well as its effectors." 
"Toinvestigate this possibility, we examined Chk1 and Chk2 phosphorylation in response to UV and IR (targets of Atr and Atm activation, respectively)." 
"Western blot analyses showed that IR increased the phosphorylation of ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase, checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2), ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related (ATR) protein, checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) and p53." 
"Additional studies in this report indicate that the inhibition of IR induced Rac1 activation abolishes IR induced activation of Chk1 and Chk2 kinases and subsequent Cdc2-Tyr15 phosphorylation." 
"Similar to Tel2 (WT), Tel2 deficient MEFs expressing either the Tel2 (2A) or (4A) mutants exhibited robust Chk1 Ser345 phosphorylation and Chk2 phosphorylation in response to UV and IR, respectively (B)." 
"ATR dependent phosphorylation of Chk1 in response to IR has also been observed in mouse embryo fibroblasts harboring conditional ATR alleles (XREF_BIBR)." 
"In contrast with this view, we now have data showing that this Chk1 phosphorylation in response to IR is the outcome of a fine regulation that derives from the coordinated action of both ATM and ATR." 
"Altogether, our data demonstrates that whereas Chk1 activation in response to DSBs arising at stalled replication forks is strictly dependent on ATR, the phosphorylation of Chk1 in response to IR is coordinately regulated by a sequential ATM --> ATR dependent pathway." 
"From these results, it was presumed that the small but obvious induction of NF-kappaB transcriptional activation by IR in AT5BIVA cells could be due to the increased phosphorylation of GSK-3beta by IR in these cells as in B, and that high level of activation seen in MRC5CV1 could be attributable to the additive effects from both IkappaBalpha degradation pathway and GSK-3beta phosphorylation." 
"Given that transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB and the increased phosphorylation of GSK-3beta in response to IR could be detected both in ATM deficient cells and in normal cells (A), their possible association was examined using the PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin and LY294002." 
"Although the data are expressed in fold induction, the level of actual activation was similar in both cell types (data not shown), confirming the suggestion that GSK-3 phosphorylation could be induced independently of ATM, and that transcriptional activation of NF-kappaB by IR could be mediated through GSK-3 phosphorylation even without ATM expression.Given that IR increased the phosphorylation of GSK-3beta and NF-kappaB transcriptional activation as described above, we examined whether another potent DNA damaging agent, camptothecin (CPT), could also induce the similar signaling in both cell types." 
"Thus, we present new data demonstrating that ATM independent GSK-3 phosphorylation by IR functions on NF-kappaB transcriptional activation and that compared to the normal cells, ATM deficient cells are resistant to LiCl induced apoptosis, possibly through the phosphorylation of GSK-3 and p53.Embryonic lung human fibroblasts MRC5CV1 and ATM deficient fibroblasts AT5BIVA were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 2mM -glutamine, hydrocortisone (0.5 mug/ml) and 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, and were cultured in a humidified CO incubator at 37degreesC." 
"At any rate, we have provided clear evidence that phosphorylation of GSK-3 in response to IR could also occur in ATM deficient cells.The crucial role of GSK-3 phosphorylation has been observed in a variety of biological processes." 
"One mechanism whereby GSK3beta increases insulin resistance is by phosphorylating IRS-1 on Ser332, resulting in reduced tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor and reduced signaling to downstream components (XREF_BIBR)." 
"A similar result was observed in cells expressing the PKCdelta shRNA 2 construct (), suggesting that changes in IRS-1 Ser24 phosphorylation were not due to off target effects of the PKCdelta shRNA.A proximal event in the transduction of the insulin signal is the Tyr phosphorylation of IRS proteins catalyzed by the insulin receptor kinase." 
"Insulin stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by the insulin receptor (IR) results in intracellular transduction of the insulin signal, whereas serine/threonine phosphorylation modulates the function of tyrosine phosphorylated IRS-1 in either a positive or negative manner [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Evidence of an EGFR-IRS-1 interaction arises from reports by Fujioka and colleagues [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR], who reported that the phosphorylated NPXY motifs in activated IR and IGF-IR to which IRS molecules bind are also present in the C-terminus region of activated EGFR and were indispensable for EGF induced IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation in EGFR transfected CHO cells [XREF_BIBR]."

"Tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) by the insulin receptor permits this docking protein to interact with signaling proteins that promote insulin action." 
"Increasing the concentration of Stat5 proteins in cells favors the direct phosphorylation of Stat5 by the IR kinase where the DN-JAK inhibition of insulin stimulated Stat5 activation becomes insignificant."

"EC silencing of integrin beta4 (siITGB4) resulted in significant increases in both basal and LPS induced phosphorylation of ERK 1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK, consistent with robust MAPK activation." 
"We further have found that JNK does not phosphorylate MAPK and that MAPK does not phosphorylate JNK." 
"These findings showed that the phosphorylation of ERK induced by cicaprost was specifically attenuated by its upstream kinase inhibitors, but not by inhibitors of JNK and p38 MAPK."

"However, since JNK induced apoptosis does not require either ectopic c-Myc expression or serum starvation, the role of c-Myc phosphorylation by JNK is unclear.The considerations outlined above indicate that a new approach that allows the direct biochemical analysis of apoptotic signaling in the absence of JNK is required." 
"Induction of STAT3 Tyr705 and Ser727 phosphorylations by Galpha (s) QL was suppressed by inhibition of protein kinase A, Janus kinase 2/3, Rac1, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and a similar profile was observed in response to beta2-adrenergic receptor stimulation."

"Active MAP kinase can inhibit the TSC1 and TSC2 complex by specifically phosphorylating TSC2, or indirectly through activation of RSK, and thereby activating mTOR1 (;)." 
"Similarly, Ras induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3 '-kinase/Akt () and ribosomal S6 kinase would be predicted to inactivate TSC2 (), resulting in activation of Rheb and mTOR.Interestingly, B-Raf activation should also theoretically result in mTOR activation, because p42 mitogen activated protein kinase, which is a downstream effector of B-Raf, directly phosphorylates and inactivates TSC2 ()." 
"Activation of the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt or Ras and mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway by growth factors leads to TSC2 phosphorylation and inhibition of the TSC protein complex by Akt, extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK), and p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 1 (RSK1) kinases (XREF_FIG)."

"JNK phosphorylation of YAP1 is required to stabilize p63 through direct binding with YAP1 XREF_BIBR."

"Moreover, in melanoma cells, the BRAFV600E specific kinase inhibitor vemurafinib did not inhibit PAK phosphorylation of MEK in cells homozygous for BRAFV600E, suggesting that that mutant BRAF may not signal through PAK as efficiently in these cells (XREF_BIBR)." 
"PAK1 phosphorylates Raf and MEK and facilitates the Ras/Raf/MAPK signalling pathway in COS fibroblasts and hence could play an important role in CRC development." 
"In NRAS-mutant and BRAF and NRAS-wild-type melanomas, inhibition of PAK1 through either siRNA knockdown or the PAK1 inhibitor PF-3758309 suppresses ERK phosphorylation and was associated with the reduction growth in a BRAF and NRAS-wild-type melanoma xenograft model (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Although PAK1 phosphorylates mitogen activated protein kinase kinase 1/2 (MEK1/2) directly and activates the Rac1-PAK-Mek1/2-Erk1/2 pathway in non small cell lung cancer, PAK1 and PAK3 promote anchorage independent cell growth through Raf1 phosphorylation." 
"Importantly, activated Pak1 elicited phosphorylation of the ERK and JNK dependent pathway in gastric cancer cell lines." 
"However, loss of Pak activity did not reduce Erk phosphorylation." 
"Here, we found that the PAK selective inhibitor peptide PAK18, which has been used to interfere selectively with the activation of PAKs 1-3 in cell cultures and experiments, not only reduced infectious viral titers but also significantly suppressed ERK 1/2 phosphorylation ()." 
"In comparison to other Pak1 substrates, S111 is very similar to two other widely documented sequences that Pak1 phosphorylates, S338 of Raf-1, RPRGQRDSSYYWEIE and S297 of MEK, RTPGRPLSSYGMDSR."

"Pak1, and as well Pak5, induce phosphorylation of Raf1 at Ser338 and stimulate translocation of a subpopulation of Raf1 to the mitochondria [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR]." 
"Here we demonstrate that Pak2 phosphorylates Myc at three sites (T358, S373, and T400) and affects Myc functions both in vitro and in vivo."

"PAK directly phosphorylates MEK1 on S298, which then induces MEK1 autophosphorylation on S218/222 and increases kinase activity toward ERK XREF_BIBR and phosphorylates Raf on Ser338 XREF_BIBR, which is known as MEK activator." 
"Pak can phosphorylate Raf-1 on serine 338 and induce phosphorylation of Mek1 on serine 298." 
"Pak phosphorylates two mediators of the MAP kinase pathway, MEK1 and Raf1, at Ser298 and at Ser338, respectively [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR]." 
"In addition, activated PDK1 phosphorylates Akt2 at Thr309." 
"These data strongly suggested that, in addition to the important enzyme-substrate recognition at the active site, the interactions involving helices alphaEF and alphaG exert an auxiliary function in PAK1 -activation.Most contact residues that mediate binding in the EF and G helices are fairly conserved among the PAKs () but not in other kinases such as PDK1, which have been shown to phosphorylate PAK1 Thr423." 
"The biological significance of PDK1 phosphorylation of PAK1 at threonine 423 in vitro is supported by the observation that these two proteins interact in vivo and that PDK1 phosphorylated PAK1 has an increased activity toward substrate." 
"ROS determine the activation of PDK1, which in turn phosphorylates PAK1 on threonine 423." 
"For example, PAK1 can be directly phosphorylated on Thr423 by PDK1 XREF_BIBR." 
"PAK1 phosphorylation at T423 in the activation loop in the kinase domain, which is mediated by PDK1 (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), plays a role in stabilizing the active site (XREF_BIBR)." 
"It is interesting to note that PDK1 phosphorylation of PAK1 at T423 is involved in actin polymerization in normal cells (XREF_BIBR), but does not significantly affect tumor cell growth (XREF_BIBR)." 
"PDK1 phosphorylates PAK1 on threonine 423, a conserved site in the activation loop of kinase subdomain VIII which is involved in the regulation of PAK1 kinase activity."

"We have shown here that PDK1 phosphorylates wild-type avian RSK1 and is even capable of activating the isolated RSK1 amino-terminal kinase domain." 
"Although PDK1 could phosphorylate full-length RSK1 (), it was possible that PDK1 did not regulate the phosphorylation of full-length RSK1." 
"This basal phosphorylation is consistent with our observations that D1 ' has high basal activity relative to the serum stimulated activity level, and that expression of a kinase-inactive PDK1 can decrease D1 ' basal phosphotransferase activity.Although PDK1 does phosphorylate Akt and PKBalpha, p70 and RSK1, there are differences in the phospholipid requirement for this phosphorylation." 
"P90RSK is phosphorylated by MAPK, p38MAPK, ERK5MAPK, PDK1, TIF1alpha, GSK3alpha, GSK3alpha, and fibroblast growth factor receptor-3 (FGFR3) and is known to be up-regulated in breast and prostate cancer."

"It is noted that even though the inhibitors of PI3K and PDK1 (wortmannin and OSU03012) did not completely abolish the phosphorylation of Akt (S473), it completely inhibited the association of PPP1R12A with IRS1."

"In a time course experiment, however, we show that the phosphorylation of AKT S473 resumes gradually up to the untreated cell levels within 24 hours of PP242 treatment and inhibition of PI3K fails to block the AKT S473 phosphorylation." 
"Akt phosphorylated by PI-3K at Ser 473 phosphorylates and inactivates TSC2 and leads to the activation of mTOR [XREF_BIBR]."

"Pharmacologic inhibition of PI3K or Akt potently decreased FoxO phosphorylation, as expected (XREF_FIG)." 
"The PI3K and AKT pathway phosphorylates all of these FOXO proteins, resulting in impairment of DNA binding ability and inhibition of FOXO dependent transcription [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Because FOXO3a is directly phosphorylated by the PI3K regulated AGC kinases AKT (XREF_BIBR) and SGK-1 (XREF_BIBR), we sought to establish the kinetics of FOXO3a dephosphorylation at the relevant sites after PI3K inhibition." 
"The pharmacological PI3K inhibitors, wortmannin or LY294002, were used to assess the contribution of the PI3K pathway in TNFalpha induced FOXO3 phosphorylation." 
"Moreover, PI3K phosphorylates FKHRL-1, inhibiting its transcriptional activity and leading to the decrease of the p21 and p27 mRNA ()." 
"We conclude that phosphorylation of an endogenous FKHRL1 related protein is induced by IGF1 by a PI3K dependent mechanism.Taken together, these experiments indicate that growth factor activation of the PI3K and Akt pathway is both necessary and sufficient to induce the phosphorylation of FKHRL1 at T32, S253, and S315 within cells.We next investigated the effect of Akt phosphorylation on the function of FKHRL1 as a transcription factor." 
"Further, insulin stimulated c-Jun phosphorylation was not blocked by inhibitors of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and mammalian target of rapamycin, indicating that c-Jun N-terminal kinase is unlikely to be the kinase phosphorylating IRS-1 Ser (312) in response to insulin." 
"Activated PI3-K and AKT and ERK1/2 signaling pathways phosphorylate c-Jun, which in turn transactivates MMP-1 that is responsible for the potentiation of the invasion of human chondrosarcoma cells.In this study, we found that MMP-1 is markedly induced in human chondrosarcoma tissues and shear activated chondrosarcoma cells."

"This novel ERalpha mediated non canonical autophagy pathway, which we describe here, is mTOR and PI3K independent as the PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin did not reduce the autophagic flux in ERalpha expressing cells and phosphorylation of mTOR is not altered." 
"The inhibition of the PiT-1-mediated Pi influx by PFA prevented the high Pi induced autophagy and reversed the inhibition of Akt and mTOR phosphorylation."

"We have also used phospho specific antibodies to T1462 to demonstrate PI3K dependent phosphorylation of endogenous tuberin." 
"The positive regulation of mTORC1 by growth factor induced TSC2 inhibition occurs primarily through the activation of the PI3K and Akt pathway, whereby Akt directly phosphorylates and inhibits TSC2 (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR)." 
"The growth factor stimulated and PI3K dependent phosphorylation of tuberin is not limited to PDGF treated NIH-3T3 cells." 
"Activated PI3K and AKT and MAPK pathways phosphorylate TSC2 (tuberin), a component of tuberous sclerosis complex, which leads to its dissociation from TSC1 (hamartin)." 
"Therefore, mammalian tuberin is phosphorylated by a PI3K dependent S/T kinase on a site recognized by this RxRxxS and T-motif antibody.We next determined the time course of growth factor induced RxRxxS/T phosphorylation of tuberin." 
"Under both conditions, tuberin phosphorylation is blocked by inhibition of PI3K with wortmannin."

"The mTORC1 cascade is initiated by the PI3K dependent activation of AKT which phosphorylates and inactivates TSC1 and TSC2 (tuberin), negative regulators of mTOR activation."

"Phosphorylation of MYC by PLK1 increases its association with beta-TrCP, thereby enhancing MYC stability." 
"We report that sequential MYC phosphorylation by PKA and PLK1 protects MYC from proteasome mediated degradation." 
"On the other hand, shRNA mediated downregulation of PLK1 led to dramatic reduction of CRAF phosphorylation at S338, S339, and S621, which was rescued by WT PLK1, but not KM PLK1 (XREF_FIG and XREF_FIG)." 
"Significant reduction in phosphorylation of CRAF at S338 and S339 was immediately observed upon treatment with the higher dose of the PLK1 inhibitor (XREF_FIG), thereby suggesting that PLK1 indeed directly phosphorylates CRAF at S338 and S339." 
"To further confirm that PLK1 directly phosphorylates CRAF at S338 and S339, cells were synchronized in M phase by nocodazole treatment followed by a transient inhibition of PLK1 activity with 2 different concentrations of BI 2536 for 30min." 
"Our data support a dual mechanism model of PLK1 mediated regulation of CRAF signaling (XREF_FIG) : PLK1 directly interacts with and phosphorylates CRAF at S338 and S339, which leads to CRAF activation."

"AMPK was activated [Thr 172 phosphorylation in the AMPK activation loop and phosphorylation of substrate ACCalpha (acetyl coenzyme A-carboxylase-alpha)] by all agents (XREF_FIG)." 
"AMPK phosphorylates ACC1 at multiple residues, although phosphorylation at a single serine (Ser 79 in rat and Ser 80 in human ACC1) accounts for the resulting inactivation [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR]." 
"The increased AMPK dependent phosphorylation of ACC that we observed in Sirt4KO mice highlights the physiological significance of Sirt4-AMPK signaling in fatty acid oxidation." 
"The molecular mechanism of the phosphorylation and inactivation of human ACC2 by AMPK can be summarized as the binding of Ser222 phosphorylated by AMPK to the dimer interface of the BC domain, and thereby inhibiting polymerization, which is essential for the activity of the protein.From our structural information and the native gel experiments, we can suggest a scenario of the acute ACC regulation including polymerization of ACC and inactivation via phosphorylation by AMPK (B)." 
"AMPK phosphorylates and inhibits acetyl-CoA-carboxylase (ACC), leading to a decrease in malonyl-CoA levels, which ultimately results in increased carnitine palmitoyl transferase (CPT1) dependent transport and oxidation of fatty acids in mitochondria [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR]." 
"While in vitro synthesized NBR2 alone did not lead to ACC phosphorylation, the addition of NBR2 (but not the T1 fragment of NBR2 , the AMPK non-binding mutant) to the AMPK complex significantly increased ACC phosphorylation by AMPK ( xref )." 
"Phosphorylation of ACC by AMPK reduces its activity with the consequent decrease in de novo fatty acid synthesis." 
"Our data revealed that overexpression of AMPK CA in NBR2 knockdown cells restored ACC or S6 phosphorylation under glucose starvation condition as expected (XREF_FIG), and correspondingly, significantly rescued cell proliferation, apoptosis, and anchorage independence growth under glucose starvation conditions in NBR2 deficient cells (XREF_FIG)." 
"It is well established that AMPK can phosphorylate and inhibit ACCbeta activity, thereby lowering malonyl-CoA levels and stimulating mitochondrial FAO." 
"While in vitro synthesized NBR2 alone did not lead to ACC phosphorylation, the addition of NBR2 (but not the T1 fragment of NBR2, the AMPK non binding mutant) to the AMPK complex significantly increased ACC phosphorylation by AMPK (XREF_FIG)." 
"However, similar to AMPK, the minor pool of ACC localized at the mitochondria was robustly phosphorylated following AMPK activation (G)." 
"Decreased ACC activity corresponds to an increase in the activity of 5 '-AMP activated protein kinase (AMPK), which phosphorylates and inhibits ACC." 
"Phosphorylation of ACC and SREBP-1c by AMPK leads to inhibition of ACC and SREBP-1c activity, resulting in increased fatty acid oxidation and decreased lipogenesis (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR)." 
"To decipher the molecular mechanism of ACCs inactivation through phosphorylation by AMPK, we determined the crystal structures of human ACC2 BC domain phosphorylated by AMPK, revealing that the phosphorylated Ser222 binds to the dimer interface of BC domain, disrupting the polymerization as soraphen A, whereas the unphosphorylated Ser222 is disordered in the previous structure of the unphosphorylated BC domain." 
"Inhibition of AMPK activation by compound C or dominant negative AMPK mutant abrogated the EPO induced increase in the phosphorylation of AMPK, ACC, and eNOS, as well as nitric oxide (NO) production." 
"Our data showed that bacterial purified GST-ACC (aa 1-130) could be readily phosphorylated by the AMPK complex precipitated from cell lysates of HEK293T cells co-transfected with AMPKalpha/beta/gamma constructs (XREF_FIG)." 
"However, in all tissues the greatest inhibition occurs when ACC is phosphorylated by AMPK." 
"The motif surrounding serine 15 of p53 (serine 18 in mouse), a site known to undergo phosphorylation during p53 activation, is similar to the motif on ACC phosphorylated by AMPK (C), raising the possibility that this site is also targeted by AMPK kinase activity."

"AMPK inhibition prevented the phosphorylation of ACC but had no effect on p53 Ser18 phosphorylation (B)." 
"To assess whether attenuation of MEK-ERK signaling by AMPK activation is dependent on the phosphorylation of BRAF by AMPK at Ser729, we stably expressed FLAG tagged WT or FLAG tagged S729A phosphorylation deficient mutant of BRAF in Braf-null MEFs via retroviral infection." 
"Here we report that AMPK phosphorylates BRAF at Ser729, promotes its association with 14-3-3 signaling adaptor and disrupts the hetero-dimerization of BRAF with KSR1 and CRAF (also known as RAF1)." 
"Phosphorylation of BRAF at Ser729 by AMPK promotes its association with 14-3-3." 
"Together, these results support the hypothesis that phosphorylation of BRAF Ser729 by AMPK in response to AICAR plays an inhibitory role on keratinocyte cell cycle progression and cell proliferation." 
"These results suggest that the relevant effect of Ser729 phosphorylation of BRAF by AMPK does not involve the inhibition of BRAF kinase catalytic activity per se." 
"AMPK Phosphorylates BRAF at Ser729." 
"Phosphorylation of the LXRXX (S/T) motif increased with treatment of AICAR, indicating that AMPK directly phosphorylates HER2 and EGFR proteins." 
"As shown in Figure XREF_FIG, AICAR activates AMPK at doses of less than 1 mM, and this AMPK activation results in markedly diminished phosphorylation of HER2 and EGFR at activating sites." 
"AMPK directly phosphorylates HER2 and EGFR at specific sequences." 
"As nicotine did not alter the phosphorylation levels of Irs1 at Ser789 (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY), a reported phosphorylation site by SIK2 and AMPK XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, nicotine enhanced phosphorylation of Irs1 at Ser307 (XREF_FIG) is unlikely due to direct AMPK phosphorylation of Irs1 as the phosphorylation of Ser789 would have likely then been affected also." 
"Therefore, AMPK directly phosphorylated p38 and regulated its activity." 
"To examine whether AMPK directly phosphorylates p38 and regulates its activity, immunoprecipitation of cell lysates with AMPK, followed by immunoblot analysis using anti-p-p38 antibody was performed." 
"Inhibition of AMPK activity with its pharmacological inhibitor, compound C, attenuated phosphorylation of AMPK, but had no effect on nucleotide induced eNOS phosphorylation (XREF_FIG)." 
"We identified an AMPK siRNA that inhibited AMPK expression and phosphorylation (XREF_FIG)." 
"However, there are two other AMPK kinases that have also been shown to directly phosphorylate the AMPKalpha subunit resulting in its activation." 
"Similarly, AMPKalpha and ACC phosphorylation induced by the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) or the AMPK activator 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide ribonucleotide (AICAR) were compromised by Skp2 knockdown (C and C)." 
"AMPK phosphorylated YAP as efficiently as ULK1 (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY); the efficiency of YAP (51-270) phosphorylation by AMPK was comparable with the TSC2 fragment (1300-1367)." 
"Decreased AMPK phosphorylation was accompanied, as expected, by a reduction in AMPK activity as indicated by lower levels of phosphorylated ACC (XREF_FIG), a downstream target of AMPK." 
"AMPK activation of human chondrocytes using A-769662 resulted in increased phosphorylation of AMPKalpha and was associated with increased expression of PGC-1alpha and FoxO3A (XREF_FIG), with an average of 2.7-, 3.1-, and 2.9-fold induction, respectively, as determined by densitometry in 3 different experiments." 
"Treatment of HepG2 cells with 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-D-ribonucleoside (AICAR), another typical AMPK activator, which action is caused by mimicking an increased AMP and ATP ratio, induced the AMPK phosphorylation but apparently showed no effect on the miR-122 level (XREF_FIG)." 
"With this approach, we demonstrated that PKC-alpha but not PKC-beta could phosphorylate Akt at Ser 473 in a TCR dependent manner (XREF_FIG), which is consistent with other publications [XREF_BIBR]." 
"PKC-alpha purified from T cells can phosphorylate Akt at Ser 473 in vitro upon TCR stimulation" 
"PKC-alpha purified from T cells can phosphorylate Akt at Ser 473 in vitro upon TCR stimulation." 
"As shown in XREF_FIG, compared with the basal level of Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation in the IgG well, PKC-alpha on its own did not lead to higher Akt phosphorylation." 
"Then, using an in vitro kinase assay, we demonstrated that PKC-alpha from T cells could phosphorylate Akt in a TCR dependent way." 
"Our preliminary screen demonstrated that silencing of 12% of the human kinome resulted in a 20-60% reduction in Akt (ser473) phosphorylation (fig XREF_FIG) and these include mTor, PKCalpha and PI3K which are known to modulate Akt phosphorylation." 
"As shown in B, PKCalpha readily phosphorylated Ser33 and Ser37 / Thr41 on full-length beta-catenin (beta-catenin) and CTD deletion mutant (beta-catenin)." 
"Active PKCalpha phosphorylates Src to induce PI-3K to phosphorylate AKT that subsequently activates the ERK1/2 cascade to stimulate goblet cell proliferation" 
"Active PKCalpha phosphorylates Src to induce PI-3K to phosphorylate AKT that subsequently activates the ERK1/2 cascade to stimulate goblet cell proliferation." 
"In contrast, PKC-beta was n't able to phosphorylate Akt at Ser 473 in vitro even with TCR stimulation (XREF_FIG)." 
"Since it has been shown that PKC-beta phosphorylates Akt at Ser 473 in B cells [XREF_BIBR], we wondered whether PKC (s) played similar roles in T cells." 
"The results obtained showed that under stress conditions p53 is not phosphorylated by PKCdelta and epsilon at Ser15, Ser20 and Ser46." 
"Knockdown of PKCepsilon with RNA interference inhibits Stat3 Ser727 phosphorylation and reduces the activity of Stat3, measured by DNA binding and activation of transcription." 
"In prostate adenocarcinoma cells PKCepsilon forms a complex with Stat3 and phosphorylates Stat3 at Ser 727 [XREF_BIBR]." 
"These results suggest that the ability of PKCtheta to phosphorylate BAD is enhanced by the co-expression of Raf-1 and B-Raf." 
"This is consistent with our results showing that PKCtheta, but not Raf-1 or B-Raf, can phosphorylate BAD directly (A)." 
"In LAM and TSC cells, FAK inhibition caused the reduction of Akt phosphorylation, which was followed by inhibition of phosphorylation and autophosphorylation of mTOR, and consequently by a strong reduction of S6 phosphorylation as it occurs in non adherent cells." 
"FAK siRNA did not affect pressure induced PI3K activation but blocked Akt phosphorylation." 
"We observed that inhibition of FAK inhibited not only Akt phosphorylation but also myofibroblast differentiation (XREF_FIG)." 
"Rapamycin activated AKT and FAK down-regulation inhibited AKT phosphorylation." 
"We found that the levels of phosphorylated (p-) AKT, mTOR, Bad, Src, FAK, and paxillin were higher in the stable CHIP knockdown Panc-1 and BxPC-3 cells, and the levels of p-AKT, p-mTOR, p-Bad, p-Src, p-FAK, and p-paxillin significantly decreased in CHIP OE cells, while the total protein did not change in the CHIP knockdown and CHIP OE cells." 
"These data provide evidence that the increased FAK activity in these tumors contributes to phosphorylation of Shc and likely to the promotion of Ras activity, extracellular signal regulated kinase-2 activation, and cell proliferation in vivo." 
"However, addition of FAK siRNA reduced ERK1 and ERK2 phosphorylation in all conditions (), demonstrating that ECM induced ERK phosphorylation occurred through a FAK signaling pathway." 
"However, the molecular mechanism by which these synergic effects occur remains elusive.Here, we describe an important role for FAK in IGF-1R activation by showing that FAK enables a-loop independent IGF-1R phosphorylation and Akt and ERK activation upon ligand stimulation." 
"Membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies : antiphosphotyrosine FAK (Tyr397, Tyr576/7, Tyr925), phosphorylated Src (pTyr419, (n-p) Tyr530), phosphorylated ERK (p-ERK), FAK, GAPDH, Src, and ERK, which were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology." 
"We also found blockage of FAK activation by Y15 reduced the phosphorylation of Src and ERK, and inhibition of Src activation with PP2 reduced both FAK and ERK activation of JEG-3 cells induced by CsA." 
"These results both confirm previous siRNA findings that FAK activation stimulates ERK1/2 phosphorylation and also stimulates expression of osteogenic markers.The signaling mechanisms linking integrin binding with the commitment of hMSC to the osteogenic lineage are essentially unknown." 
"Transient FAK silencing in Me # 28 cells induced 35% reduction of ERK phosphorylation (XREF_FIG), confirming that FAK expression and/or activation could regulate ERK phosphorylation." 
"Furthermore, reduction of FAK or ERK1/2 phosphorylation by FAK small interfering RNA (FAK siRNA) potentiated the effect of alpha-mangostin." 
"This model may also explain LCK-SHP2-induced ERK activation in nonattached cells, as FRNK inhibits both 397 Y-FAK phosphorylation and ERK activation in nonattached LCK-SHP2 cells." 
"However, dual inhibition of FAK, using either a dominant negative construct (FAK-CD) or small interfering RNA, and IGF-1R, using a specific small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor (AEW-541) or stable expression of a truncated, mutated IGF-1R, led to a synergistic decrease in cell proliferation and phosphorylation of extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK) and increase in cell detachment and apoptosis compared with inhibition of either pathway alone." 
"Whereas, CDKs phosphorylate Rb in mid to late G1 phase (XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR), our lab has demonstrated that Raf-1 kinase binds and phosphorylates Rb early in the G1 phase (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Furthermore, the small molecule, RRD-251, previously shown to prevent Rb inactivation by blocking Raf1 kinase phosphorylation of Rb, also facilitates HLA-DRA induction in the cells studied here." 
"Further, Raf-1 was able to phosphorylate Rb in vitro quite efficiently." 
"Le Boeuef et al (2006) proposed a mechanism whereby ROCK1 phosphorylates FAK at Ser732 and that this phosphorylation is required for subsequent phosphorylation of Tyr407, possibly by Pyk2 XREF_BIBR."

"Y-27632 and ROCK siRNA inhibits the phosphorylation of LIMK2 and Cofilin." 
"In addition to regulating polarity through myosin activity, ROCK2 phosphorylated the actin-severing protein cofilin on Ser3, resulting in adhesion and PSD maturation." 
"In an attempt to elucidate the mechanism of SecPH inhibition of cofilin phosphorylation by ROCK activated LIMK2, we postulated that SecPH might prevent LIMK2 from interacting with ROCK." 
"However, since both MPYT1 and Cofilin can be phosphorylated by ROCK independent mechanisms, their phosphorylation state may or may not accurately monitor ROCK activity." 
"While our studies found that Cofilin, rather than MYPT1, provided a more accurate biomarker for pan-ROCK inhibitor treatment, our use of isoform specific siRNA to selectively silence ROCK1 or ROCK2 found that inhibition of either isoform alone inhibited anchorage independent growth, yet inhibition of both ROCK1 and ROCK2 were required to suppress Cofilin phosphorylation." 
"ROCK, which is a downstream effector of Rho, did not phosphorylate cofilin directly but phosphorylated LIM-kinase, which in turn was activated to phosphorylate cofilin." 
"ROCKII inhibition (H-1152) and siRNA suppression also reduced cofilin phosphorylation in stathmin suppressed cells, indicating that ROCKII mediates stathmin 's regulation of cofilin phosphorylation." 
"Inhibition of ROCK did not significantly decrease leading-edge cofilin phosphorylation in RacQL expressing cells (12% decrease compared to uninhibited RacQL cells, p = 0.544) (A and 1B)."

"The kinase-dead RSK1 mutant, however, was unable to phosphorylate YB-1 at S102." 
"On one hand, Erk phosphorylates and activates p90RSK, and on the other hand, Erk serves as an adaptor and priming kinase through binding to the DEF domain of GSK-3beta and phosphorylating GSK-3beta at the T residue, to facilitate phosphorylation of GSK-3beta by p90RSK on Ser9, which leads to the inactivation of GSK-3beta." 
"Initially, using an in vitro kinase assay, we show that RSK1 and RSK2 are able to directly phosphorylate an YB-1 S102 peptide that mimics the region surrounding the S102 site." 
"More specifically it is the serine/threonine kinases RSK1 and RSK2 that are able to phosphorylate YB-1 at the key S102 residue in BLBC cells." 
"The RSK1 and RSK2 specific inhibitor SL0101 [XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR], as well as RSK1 targeted or RSK2 targeted siRNA, were able to reduce the phosphorylation of YB-1 at S102 even following induction by the classic tumour promoter PMA." 
"We conclude that RSK1 and RSK2 are able to phosphorylate YB-1 S102, providing a newly described mechanism whereby this transcription factor is activated in breast cancer." 
"Silencing of hSPRY2 also inhibited serum induced activation of p90RSK and decreased phosphorylation of pro apoptotic protein BAD (BCL2-antagonist of cell death) by p90RSK." 
"Neither PHAS-I nor PHAS-II was phosphorylated by the insulin stimulated protein kinases, p90rsk or plO ^." 
"Another important finding is identification of a mechanism to elucidate accurately how the Erk and p90RSK pathway phosphorylates and inactivates GSK-3beta." 
"These results confirm that 10muM BI-D1870 inhibits the phosphorylation of most RSK targets stronger than 100muM SL0101.The activity of p70S6K was differentially affected by the two inhibitors, which could mask the real RSK dependent phosphorylation of rpS6." 
"The off-target effects of the RSK inhibitors on p70S6K made it impossible to determine the true RSK actions on PMA induced rpS6 phosphorylation." 
"However, with the use of rapamycin, PMA induced phosphorylation of rpS6 by RSK could be detected, and this was confirmed by siRNA mediated depletion of RSK1 and RSK2." 
"The activity of p70S6K was differentially affected by the two inhibitors, which could mask the real RSK dependent phosphorylation of rpS6." 
"Thus, to detect the phosphorylation of rpS6 by RSK we used the mTORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin (A)." 
"RSK may also induce rpS6 phosphorylation by regulating tuberin (TSC2) and raptor, thereby resulting in activation of mTORC1-p70S6K." 
"Inhibition of the 4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation by ectopic S6K1 overexpression seems to be specific for the mTOR pathway, because a similar inhibition of 4E-BP1 and S6K1 phosphorylation is seen with rapamycin." 
"Surprisingly, the long, kinase active S6K1 isoform (Iso-1) inhibited 3D acinus formation and reduced 4E-BP1 phosphorylation, cap dependent translation, and transformation invitro and invivo, demonstrating many properties that characterize a tumor suppressor." 
"In addition, S6K1 also phosphorylates the ribosomal protein 4EBP1, releases it from hindering the elongation initiation factor 4E (elF4E) and thus promotes mRNA translation." 
"mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70S6 kinase (p70S6K), which in turn phosphorylates the S6 ribosomal protein and 4E-BP1, leading to protein translation (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Expression of peroxiredoxin 1 (Prx1) had no effect on p70S6K and S6 phosphorylation.Nonphosphorylated 4E-BP1 binds and sequesters eIF-4E, thereby inhibiting formation of the eIF-4F complex involved in initiation of Cap dependent translation of a subset of mRNAs that include cyclin D1 and c-Myc ()." 
"8-CPT-INDUCED INCREASE IN PHOSPHORYLATION OF S6K, 4EBP-1, AND eIF4E, 4EBP1, RSK, AND MNK1 IN 1-LN CELLS STIMULATED WITH 8-CPT." 
"The mTORC1 controls the rate of protein synthesis through phosphorylation and activation of its substrates, p70S6 ribosomal kinase 1 (p70S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) binding protein-1 (4E-BP1) and once phosphorylated, p70S6K phosphorylates ribosomal protein S6 and 4E-BP1 becomes dissociated from eIF4 and promote mRNA translation and protein synthesis [XREF_BIBR]." 
"Insulin stimulated phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, as assessed by retarded band migration on SDS-PAGE immunoblots, is inhibited by overexpression of S6K1."

"Moreover, GSK3alpha and beta can also be phosphorylated by p70S6K following loss of the TSC1 and TSC2 complex." 
"In this manner, we can not rule out the off-target inhibition of Akt phosphorylation at S473 as the cause for the strong inhibitory effect of SL0101 on mTORC1.A greater inhibition of proliferation was observed in the presence of 100muM SL0101 when compared to 1muM BI-D1870, yet these concentrations inhibit RSK dependent phosphorylation of rpS6, eIF4B, and GSK3alpha to a similar extent." 
"Our data demonstrate that, under conditions in which growth factor stimulation of Akt is attenuated, S6K1 can directly phosphorylate and inhibit GSK3 in vivo (C, bottom)." 
"Our finding that GSK3 is constitutively phosphorylated by S6K1 in TSC deficient MEFs suggests that GSK3 remains inhibited in these cells under serum starvation conditions."

"In addition, S6K1 Iso-1 can phosphorylate mTOR at serine 2448 (F, A, and A), although the consequences of this phosphorylation on mTOR activity are not fully understood (;)."

"Visfatin also increased HIF1alpha expression in a rapamycin-inhibitable manner, but it increased Akt phosphorylation at Ser 473 in a rapamycin independent manner (B), suggesting that visfatin increases VEGF expression via the mTOR signaling pathway.To confirm that mTOR signaling is involved in visfatin induced VEGF expression, we examined the effect of knockdown of p70S6K, which reportedly mediates mTOR phosphorylation at Ser 2448." 
"In addition, S6K1 short isoforms can not induce mTOR S2448 phosphorylation, as they lack a functional kinase domain and are catalytically inactive (A and E-S2G)." 
"In this work, the use of three different RSK-targets in conditions where the contribution of other AGC-kinases was low or absent, provided the same conclusions regarding RSK inhibition.Originally, RSK dependent phosphorylation of S235 and S236 on rpS6 was identified as an ERK1/2 dependent and rapamycin resistant event."

"ERK1/2 activation in PCa cells was regulated by Class IA PI3K isoforms, Src, and FAK in LNCaP cells treated with CXCL13; however, both Class IA and Class IB PI3K isoforms as well as Src and FAK could lead to ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PC3 cells treated with CXCL13." 
"As expected, TH1-WT inhibited ERK phosphorylation driven by c-Src (XREF_FIG)." 
"The EGFR inhibitor AG 1478, Src kinase inhibitor 1, and MEK 1/2 inhibitor PD184161 all effectively blocked the ERK1/2 phosphorylation."

"Kinase assays were performed with cTnI as substrate - without and with Src - to determine whether Thr 295 and Thr 141 influence PKCdelta-Thr 505 phosphorylation, PKCdelta tyrosine phosphorylation by Src, and/or PKCdelta phosphorylation of cTnI." 
"Thus, PKCdelta is phosphorylated and its activity down regulated by v-Src in v-Src transformed cells, whereas PKCdelta activity and tyrosine phosphorylation were upregulated by Src in other model systems." 
"The tyrosine phosphorylation of PKCdelta and the decrease in GS expression induced by platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) were abolished by the Src kinase inhibitors PP1 and PP2."

"Then src phosphorylates FAK on tyrosine 925, which leads to the recruitment of Grb-2 (an adapter protein) and SOS (a regulator of ras-type GTPases) to the FAK signaling complex" 
"Since Brk and c-Src are both able to phosphorylate STAT5b on Y699, the potential cooperation between Brk and c-Src was investigated." 
"These conformational differences may in part be due to differential effects of Prl and Src on Stat5b tyrosine phosphorylation, since Src induced several additional sites of tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat5b at residues other than Tyr 699, including Tyr 724 and Tyr 679."

"Although the lack of an appropriate antibody for the specific immunohistochemical detection of serine 207 residue in FOXO3 phosphorylated by MST1 kinaseprevented the detection of FoxO3 activity modified by MST1, these results, coupled with the results of in vitro assays, suggest that BRAF V600E may alleviate the tumor suppressor function of RASSF1A-MST1 and vice versa." 
"We find that the MST1 regulatory region enhances FoxO phosphorylation while inhibiting histone H2B phosphorylation, consistent with the cellular properties of MST1." 
"MST1 phosphorylates FOXO proteins at a conserved site within the forkhead domain that disrupts their interaction with 14-3-3 proteins, promotes FOXO nuclear translocation, and thereby induces cell death in neurons."

"Interestingly, shRNA mediated TBK1 silencing promoted the phosphorylation of AKT as well as the AKT-mTORC1 downstream proteins Foxo1 and S6 (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY)."

"IkappaB kinase epsilon and TANK binding kinase 1 activate AKT by direct phosphorylation." 
"In vitro kinase assays combined with reversed-phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry analysis showed that TBK1 enhanced phosphorylation of Akt on Ser (473), whereas knockdown of TBK1 expression by short interfering RNA in macrophages decreased poly (I : C) - and LPS induced Akt phosphorylation." 
"Additionally, the IkappaB kinase phosphorylates FOXO3a transcription factor, blocking its induction of proapoptotic genes." 
"Blocking of AKT and IkappaB kinase (IKK) activity prevents FOXO3a phosphorylation, leading to T CM cell death." 
"This increased expression of activated IKK in T CM could lead to FOXO3a phosphorylation and the inhibition of its transcriptional activity." 
"It has been shown in Foxo3a deficient mice and in vitro assays using human lymphocytes that the maintenance of CD34 + stem cells (XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR), T cell progenitors (XREF_BIBR) and mature central memory CD4 + T cells (T CM) (XREF_BIBR) are mediated by increased AKT, ERK and IKK kinase activities, whose functions are to induce the phosphorylation of Foxo3a (XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR, XREF_BIBR)." 
"However, we could not rule out certain minor target sites matching the putative IKK recognition sequences for phosphorylation in FOXO3a that might be phosphorylated by IKKbeta.To confirm that S644 is the site of IKK catalyzed phosphorylation of the endogenous FOXO3a protein in response to TNFalpha, we raised an Ab against a phosphopeptide corresponding to the phosphorylation site of S644 and used this Ab for IB analysis."

"Thus, IKK phosphorylation of FOXO3a also serves as a vital mechanism in promoting cell growth and tumorigenesis." 
"IKK physically interacts with and phosphorylates FOXO3a independently of Akt, which causes nuclear exclusion of FOXO3a and subsequently proteolysis of FOXO3a via the betaTrCP mediated ubiquitin (Ub)-dependent proteasome pathway (XREF_BIBR)." 
"To address if IKK could phosphorylate FOXO3a in vitro, we produced several overlapping fragments of FOXO3a (FO3a) fused to GST and used these proteins as substrates in an IKKbeta-immunocomplex kinase assay and showed that the C-terminal portion Gst-FO3a (301-673) but not the N-terminal portion Gst-FO3a (1-300) was phosphorylated by IKKbeta and the intensity of phosphorylation was comparable to that of Gst-IkappaBalpha, a known substrate of IKKbeta." 
"It is thus likely that activated AKT and IKK promote CD4 + cell survival in part by phosphorylating FOXO3a, thereby repressing its transcriptional activity and leading to the down-regulation of the proapoptotic molecule Bim." 
"Some studies reported that IKK can induce phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation of forkhead box, class O (FOXO) factors, and promote cell proliferation and tumorigenesis [XREF_BIBR]."

"While the above experiments provided strong evidence that Yes kinase preferentially phosphorylates FAK Y861 relative to the other FAK tyrosine sites, these experiments could not exclude potential roles of other SFKs expressed in PCa cells." 
"As Src is highly activated in these prostate cancer cell lines [XREF_BIBR], it may be that Src phosphorylation of FAK Y925 is sufficiently robust such that Yes can not further increase FAK Y925 phosphorylation; hence increased FAK Y925 phosphorylation was not observed in our selected cells." 
"Then src phosphorylates FAK on tyrosine 925, which leads to the recruitment of Grb-2 (an adapter protein) and SOS (a regulator of ras-type GTPases) to the FAK signaling complex." 
"Hahn and colleagues recently highlighted that, by using a YAP1 mutant for all LATS1 phosphorylation sites (5SA) including the inhibitory S127-YAP1 phosphorylation, while permissive, required additional phosphorylation of Y357-YAP1 by the SRC family kinase (SFK) YES to activate transcription [XREF_BIBR]." 
"We expressed two YAP1 mutants : YAP1 DeltaSH3bm, which disrupts the interaction of YES1 with YAP1 (XREF_BIBR; XREF_BIBR), and YAP Y357F, which prevents YES1 phosphorylation of YAP1 (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Thus, we concluded that both YES1 and SRC are able to phosphorylate YAP1 but only YES1 is essential for the survival of beta-catenin active cell lines." 
"Since the Wnt and beta-catenin pathway has been shown to be crucial for gut development in zebrafish (XREF_BIBR), we concluded that phosphorylation of YAP1 by YES1 is essential for developmental and malignant processes that are dependent on the function of beta-catenin." 
"Although both YES1 and SRC phosphorylated YAP1, suppression of SRC failed to inhibit the proliferation and AI growth of beta-catenin active cell lines (XREF_SUPPLEMENTARY)."

"A wide variety of growth factors and mitogens are known to activate the Ras-Raf-1-MEK-1/2-ERK-1/2 signaling cascade, in which Ras, activated by extracellular signals, recruits Raf-1 to the membrane, where it is activated by other protein kinases." 
"Thus, ManLAM binding to DC-SIGN leads to activation of Raf-1 independent of TLR signaling.Raf-1 activation requires recruitment of Raf-1 to the membrane through an interaction with the active form of the small GTPase Ras ()."

"Active RAS recruits RAF to the membrane for activation through a complex process involving changes in phosphorylation and binding to other enzymes and scaffold proteins (XREF_BIBR)." 
"Upon mitogenic stimulation, dephosphorylation of S259 residue by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) leads to the release of 14-3-3zeta from pS233 and pS259 site [XREF_BIBR], which results in translocation of C-Raf to the membrane and activates the downstream effector MEK kinase (MAP2K) [XREF_BIBR - XREF_BIBR]." 
"In its simplest form, RAS recruits cytosolic RAF to the plasma membrane for activation, with one of the essential steps being the phosphorylation of two amino acids (T598 and S601 of B-RAF; see Note at the end of the main text for amino acid numbering used in this review) within the activation segment of the kinase domain."

"The recruitment of Raf to the plasma membrane by GTP bound Ras leads to stimulation of Raf kinase activity through an undefined mechanism." 
"Thus, there is some evidence that Raf-1 may be recruited to the plasma membrane by phosphatidic acid rather than by its interaction with Ras, but its activation still requires activated Ras."
