;; Initiated 12/28/14 to handle moderately complicated notions
;; like cell line and mutation. Conformation and isoform and such
;; would go here. Reorganizes some items in terms. Incremental
;; extensions through 1/6/15
;; 1/9/2015 give ubiquitinate a site variable, and define "pro-apoptotic" as a subclass of "apoptotoic"
;; 1/14/2015 tweaks on N and C-terminus
;; 2/15/15 trying to make some headway with ubiquitination
;; 4/23/15 Pulled in dimer material from other files
;; 5/29/15 Added the rest of the Mitre-designated modification features
;; 5/10/17 Split out into new files: bio-complexes,
;; bio-methods-processes, cellular-processes, pathways,
;; post-trans-mods, protein-terminals-domains -- all that's left is a
;; description of transcription and its control which never had any
;; realizations
