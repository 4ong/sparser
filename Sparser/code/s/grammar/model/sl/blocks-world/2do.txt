* Generation per se

Write the lexicalized phrase and attachment for "let's"

Adapt the contraction code to handle "let us" => "let's"

All utterances need to be wrapped in a discourse unit (strictly
speaking, they need to be embedded in a slot with the label
sentence) so that the capitalization and final punctuation
is handled. The method discourse-unit was a start at this, but
