;;;   Module:  "grammar;rules:syntax:"
;;;  Version:  May 2019

;; redesigned from scratch 5/12/93 v2.3, completed category's realization
;; data 5/27. Added "there's" -> "there is", and negative contractions 1/11/94
;; 7/21 redid the aux-hopping rule in terms of the category 'be' instead of
;; each word individually.  8/1 added neg rule.  8/5 added general calculation
;; for the passive category.
;; 0.1 (8/16) flushed contraction with "it" in favor of pronoun anlysis 
;;      (///of sorts) put in by [???].
;;     (8/19) added contraction with "that".  9/6 " 'm "  11/21 " 're "
;;     5/27/96 Disabled subtyping until it's reimplemented
;; 0.2 (5/10/09) Removed the realization. It's getting in the way of things
;;     like "where are you going" by creating a 'be-something' over "are you"
;;     which is just wrong.
;;    (8/24/13) Modified lookup-passive-counterpart to use #:ed for forming
;;     the passive symbol. 
;;    (9/15/14) fixed form on be+adjective
;;  1/14/2015 correct the head for BO+AJD to be the ADJ
;;  (1/15/15) Substantial make over of rules for tense/aspect
;; 3/4/2015 make the rules that should produce VGs do so 
;;    (such as (def-form-rule (be verb+ing) ...)
;; SBCL suggested speedup on computation of passive label (VERB+ED label 
;;  created to allow passive rule to work)
;;    (4/15/15) Reformated 'there' and made it its' own section
;;  5/8/2015 handle vp+ed and vp+ing, handle AP as well as adjectives
;; 5/30/2015 take into account the introduction of vg+passive, etc.
;;  update super-catgory of there-exists to be relation
;; 9/17/15 added (be vg+ed) form rule. Worth going through the rest
;;  and ensuring they have every variant they need.

 between a subject and a predicate that is established by
 the verb to-be (the 'copula') and similar verbs. This is
 the general relation. More particular relationships are
 represented by specializations of this category that add
 or change the variables and provide restrictions on them.
 Note that because this category ihherits from perdurant
 it carries all of the variables that record information
 about tense and aspect.")

#| Note -- We don't need to give subject or predicate
value restrictions. The tests understand that the absence
of a restriction implies that it takes anything. We do have
to provide restrictions, however, when we're using an etf
since they're part of the process that makes semantic rules
(even though we handle 'be' mostly syntactically because
it indeed has no restrictions on what its two variables might
be bound to.
   We're providing an explicit statement of "be" being
the verb realization for 'be' in order to make the mumble
processing happy (see setup-mumble-data). This has the
unfortunate side-effect of generating a bunch of rules
and lexical forms that we do not use, but the alternative
is to define a new top-level def-form for 'standalone mumble
mappings' (could call it define-mumble-data), which would
end up using much of the same subroutines as the eft+explicit
verb scheme does, and we only need it for irregulars like
this -- 'have' is done the same way. |#

#| This operation has two steps. First the CS rule changes
the apostrophe-s (see apostrophe-fsa) into the word "is".
Then in the edge construction process (e.g. make-default-binary-edge)
the call to complete is immediately followed by a call to
assess-edge-label, which rewrites the word as the category BE.

    turns out to be cleft.        |#
