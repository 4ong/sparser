;; moved from [syntax;aux verbs] 5/7/93 v2.3
;; 0.1 (5/15) giving it some real semantic content
;;     (1/10/94) added event.  1/11 added negative
;; 0.2 (6/14) defined 'anonymouse-agentive-action' as referent of do
;; 0.3 (7/12) added rule for infinitive.  7/14 for "don't"   7/26 rules
;;      for "does not {verb}"  8/8 made 'event' referential
;; 0.4 (1/3/98) Gave event a time variable.
;; 0.5 (5/20/09) Added additional bindings to event. Added modifier 6/9/09
;;     (7/14/09) Added participant binding to event. (4/7/11) Cleaning up.
;;     (7/31) moved event category model/core/kinds/object.
;; 0.6 (3/28/13) Removed indexing from anonymous-agentive-action as a stop-
;;      gap action in lieu of taking the time to rework the meaning of "do"
;;      properly -- the word by itself does not  have an agent linked to it.
;; 0.7 (1/14/15) Converting mixins to regular categories because they're
;;      somehow getting interpretations as psi, which is presently outlawed.
;; 1/14/2015 support for negation and other tense/aspect features
;; 4/26/15 gave negative a lemma
;; 9/22/15 Hooked up negative to quantifier, deleted the variable
;;  negative
