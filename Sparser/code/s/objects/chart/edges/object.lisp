;;     (7/13) added One-word-long?  (7/27) added case in Edge-between
;; 3.3 (1/3/95) changed the semantics of Top-edge-starting-at to access the vector
;;      in the case of ambiguous single-term-edges rather than just be sugar for 
;;      the field in the edge-vector
;;     (8/30) added literal-edge? and dotted-edge?, added hook to suppress

;; 3.4 (6/8/99) modified Set-used-by/anonymous-daughters to return the edges
;;      it sees as its value (but not the nodes or multiple-initial-edges,

make-edge-over-literal during the sweep that introduces
edges over words into the chart (see note in that function).
The are also used with abbreviations, particularly in the
routines that recognize proper names (PNF), where the
abbreviated form of a word (e.g. "Mr.") will be respanned
by an edge with the full form ("Mister"). The relevant
code is make-edge-over-abbreviation and its feeders. |#
