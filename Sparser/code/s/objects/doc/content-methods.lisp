;; Created 5/12/15 to hold the container mixings and such that need
;; to have the document model elements already defined so they can
;; be referred to. 5/27/15 Subject is now the referent rather than
;; the edge. 6/8/15 Added get-element methods and began to play with
;; after methods. 6/10/15 Added paragraph aggregator. 9/8/15 added
;; long-term-ifying mentions to paragraph. 11/3/15 Added local dynamic
;; bindings of the current document element to facilitate debugging.
;; 1/4/16 gating call to paragraph-level aggregation
