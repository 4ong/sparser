#| Aggregates the special handling of paragraph objects that
are found incrementally during the handling of large texts.

Builds on the document objects developed for Big Mechanism
and the context and content handling of Grok and C3.

Lets us start fresh (12/18) rather than try to sift through
the original orthographic paragraph handling of the early 1990s
