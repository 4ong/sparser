;; initiated 11/30/91 v2.1
;; 1.1 (7/20/92 v2.3) revised to fit new regime
;; 1.2 (12/29/93) tweeked Apply-bindings to appreciate the case of null values
;; 1.3 (3/10/94) Added optional category arg to Bind-variable to help
;;      in disambiguating the variable
;;     (8/1) added a fall-through case to that routine
;; 1.4 (8/4) added an 'incidence-count' on bindings
;; 1.5 (12/19) added a break to Bind-variable when the variable is undefined
;;     (1/7/96) added Remove-binding-from-individual
;;     (1/8) added 'when-binding' hook to Bind-variable
;; 1.6 (2/14/99) tweaked Bind-variable to appreciate the possibility of psi
;;      where it expects individuals and to then call the right routine.
;;     (5/18) adjusted that tweak to return the resulting new psi.
;;     (3/4/05) Added optional to make/binding so it only indexes the value
;;     (6/19/09) fan-out from psi changes. Capitalization tweaks.
;; 1.7 (4/5/13) Redesigned the when-binding hook.
;; 2.0 (12/28/14) Added a trap so you can't add bindings to categories.
;;      Which is debatable, but such bindings should at least be reclaimable.
;;    3/21/2015 fix overzealous correction of find/binding. 
;;      some problem in lookup for.
;;     find/binding which caused bad definition in (define-unit-of-measure ...) 
;;       for "nm"
;;    4/18/2015 removed fix to bind-variable/expr, which prevented multiple bindings 
;;     of a variable on a single individual
;; 2.1 (4/20/15) dereferenced instance of anonymous variable in 
;;      bind-variable
;;     (6/5/15) wrapped *break-on-pattern-outside-coverage?* around the 
;;      complaint in bind-variable when the individual doesn't have the variable
;;      it wants to bind.
;; 2.2 (6/27/15) Now has *description-lattice* cases. 6/30/15 pulling out
;;     now deadwood PSI cases.
;; 2.3 (11/2/15) Resurecting simple bind-variable for the simple side-effects
;;     cases.

#| What happens when we bind a variable depends on the value of
the *description-lattice* parameter. If it is non-nil we use the
lattice to record the binding and find-or-make a new variable+value
that reflects that. If the parameter is nil then we just add
the new binding to the same individual and something else keeps
track of recording that fact.

There are three entry points
  bind-variable looks at the value of *description-lattice* and calls
  bind-dli-variable it is non-nil and calls
  old-bind-variable if it is nil.

I prefer bind-variable simply because it's shorter and emphasizes
what happens rather than how it happens (ddm).  |#
