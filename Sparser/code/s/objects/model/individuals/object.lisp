;;;  version:  0.5 November 2015

;; initiated 7/16/92 v2.3
;; (6/8/93) added Indiv-typep
;; (8/7/94) added itypep as respelling of Indiv-typep and i-type-of
;; 0.1 (3/3/95) modified i-type-of to not break if it is passed an object
;;      other than an individual
;; 0.2 (9/13) extended indiv-typep to look up the lattice
;; 0.3 (8/14/13) Since itypep may be used in cases where its argument
;;      is a category (head word) rather than an individual, added a
;;      diversion for that case. 4/16/14 ditto for itype-of
;; 0.4 (6/5/15) indiv-typep now returns nil when passed a category.
;;     6/8/2015 avoid break in itypep by flagging mixin categories  
;;     7/7/15 Removing psi deadwood.
;; 0.5 (10/16/15) Cleaned up. Allowing mixins to itypep, previous
;;      change was too stringent. Inserted a convenience for the
;;      case of conjunctions, where the type is buried inside the
;;      structure. 
;;     (11/12/15) Added special routine for removing all the rules
;;      from a category given as the routines that add them aren't consistent.
