;; initiated 2/14/99 pulling bits and pieces from other files. 
;; Continued populating it through 2/15. 9/6 Corrected the definition
;; of Category-of-psi to appreciate that the type field is a list.
;; 3/26/00 Added Corresponding-lattice-point.
;; 6/18 added is-open-in
;; 1.0 (7/22/09) fan-out from variable and psi make-over. Redid category-of-psi
;;  now that we can avoid climbing. Working on it through 8/7
;;  (3/21/11) Added saturated? predicate.
;; 1.1 (10/9/15) Removed saturated? and corresponding-lattice-point
;;  to the LP operations file with an eye towards conditionaling the
;;  loading of the whole psi directory on whether the don't use flag
;;  is up.
